## Summary

Many people carry a distorted image of Jesus—a caricature shaped by culture, false teaching, or incomplete gospel presentations. This sermon calls believers to burn those false images and see the real Jesus:

- **The image of the invisible God**
- **The firstborn over all creation**
- **The one who holds all things together**
- **The reconciler of all things**

---

## Key Themes

- **The supremacy of Christ** — He is preeminent in everything
- **Christ as the image of God** — To see Jesus is to see the Father
- **Creator and sustainer** — All things created by him and for him
- **Reconciliation through blood** — Peace made through the cross
- **The cosmic scope of Christ's work** — All things reconciled to him

---

## Theological Focus

### Christology (The Person and Work of Christ)
This passage contains one of the highest Christologies in the New Testament:

1. **Deity** — Image of God, creator, sustainer
2. **Preexistence** — Before all things
3. **Creation** — All things created by him, through him, for him
4. **Sustaining Power** — In him all things hold together
5. **Resurrection** — Firstborn from the dead
6. **Reconciliation** — Peace through his blood

---

## Application

1. **Identify your caricatures** — What false images of Jesus have you believed?
2. **Worship the real Jesus** — The one who is supreme over all creation
3. **Trust his sustaining power** — He holds your life together
4. **Rest in reconciliation** — Peace has been made by his blood
5. **Continue in the faith** — Don't shift from the hope of the gospel

## Connection to Christ

The false teachers in Colossae were offering "supplements" to Christ—angel worship, mystical experiences, ascetic rules. Paul responds with the most exalted description of Christ in the Bible: **Jesus doesn't need supplements; he is the full and final revelation of God.**
