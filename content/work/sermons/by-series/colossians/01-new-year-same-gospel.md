## Summary

Happy New Year! As we begin a brand-new year together, we're launching a new sermon series through Colossians—starting with Colossians 1:1–14.

Paul writes to a young, healthy church he has never met, and his message is both simple and life-changing: **it's not Jesus plus something… it's Jesus.**

- Not Jesus + philosophy.
- Not Jesus + rules.
- Not Jesus + mystical experiences.
- Just Christ—supreme, sufficient, and preeminent.

---

## Key Themes

- **The sufficiency of Christ alone** — We don't need to add anything to the gospel
- **Rejecting syncretism** — Jesus + anything else dilutes the gospel
- **The gospel Paul preached** — Faith, love, and hope rooted in the truth
- **The lordship of Christ** — Over all philosophies and religions

---

## Outline

1. **Introduction: A New Year, The Same Gospel**
   - The temptation to seek "new" spirituality
   - Paul's timeless message: Jesus is enough

2. **Paul's Greeting (vv. 1-2)**
   - An apostle by God's will
   - To the saints and faithful brothers in Christ
   - Grace and peace from God

3. **Thanksgiving for the Colossians (vv. 3-8)**
   - Faith in Christ Jesus
   - Love for all the saints
   - The hope laid up in heaven
   - The gospel bearing fruit everywhere
   - Epaphras: a faithful minister

4. **Prayer for Spiritual Growth (vv. 9-14)**
   - Filled with the knowledge of his will
   - Walking in a manner worthy of the Lord
   - Bearing fruit in every good work
   - Increasing in the knowledge of God
   - Strengthened with all power
   - Giving thanks to the Father
   - Transferred from darkness to light
   - Redemption and forgiveness in Christ

## Key Quotes

> "Not Jesus + philosophy. Not Jesus + rules. Not Jesus + mystical experiences. Just Christ—supreme, sufficient, and preeminent."

> "The gospel isn't something we move on from; it's something we move deeper into."

---

## Application

1. **What are you tempted to add to Jesus?** Identify the "plus" in your life
2. **Rest in sufficiency** — You don't need more than Christ
3. **Pray like Paul** — For knowledge, worthy walk, fruit, strength, and thanksgiving
4. **Remember your rescue** — You've been transferred from darkness to light

---

## Connection to Christ

This opening passage establishes the foundation: **Christ is sufficient for salvation, sanctification, and every spiritual need.** The Colossians didn't need to add philosophy or legalism to their faith because Jesus had already given them everything.

## For Further Study

- Ephesians 1:3-14 (parallel opening)
- Philippians 3:1-11 (no confidence in the flesh)
- Galatians 1:6-9 (no other gospel)
