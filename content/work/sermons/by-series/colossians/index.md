# Colossians: Jesus + Nothing

*January-February 2026*

> "Not Jesus + philosophy. Not Jesus + rules. Not Jesus + mystical experiences. Just Christ—supreme, sufficient, and preeminent."

---

## Series Overview

Paul writes to a young, healthy church in Colossae that he has never visited. His message is both simple and life-changing: **it's not Jesus plus something... it's Jesus.**

This series confronts the subtle temptation to add to the gospel—whether through philosophy, legalism, or mystical experiences—and calls believers to stand firm in the complete sufficiency of Christ.

### Key Themes
- **The Supremacy of Christ** — Christ is the image of God, firstborn over creation, preeminent in everything
- **Sufficiency of the Gospel** — You don't need to add anything to Jesus
- **Union with Christ** — Being "in Christ" changes everything about how we live
- **Contending for the Faith** — The church's responsibility to guard against false teaching
- **Everyday Gospel** — The gospel isn't just for Sundays; it shapes all of life

And he is before all things, and in him all things hold together."
> — Colossians 1:15-17

> "And he is the head of the body, the church. He is the beginning, the firstborn from the dead, that in everything he might be preeminent."
> — Colossians 1:18

> "To them God chose to make known how great among the Gentiles are the riches of the glory of this mystery, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory."
> — Colossians 1:27

> "Therefore, as you received Christ Jesus the Lord, so walk in him, rooted and built up in him and established in the faith, just as you were taught, abounding in thanksgiving."
> — Colossians 2:6-7

## Application Points

1. **Examine your additions** — What are you tempted to add to Jesus? (Philosophy? Rules? Experiences?)
2. **Root yourself daily** — The gospel is an everyday reality, not just Sunday truth
3. **See the real Jesus** — Burn the caricatures; behold the preeminent Christ
4. **Contend for others** — Fight against spiritual drift in your church community
5. **Rest in fullness** — You don't need to earn what Christ has already given
