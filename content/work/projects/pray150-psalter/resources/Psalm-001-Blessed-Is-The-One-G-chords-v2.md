## Verse 1

```
G              D/F#             Em
Blessed is the one who does not walk
          C              G
in step with the wicked
       D/F#           Em
or stand in the way that
    C         D
sinners take
        G            D/F#
or sit in the company
    Em      C    D
of mockers
```

## Verse 2

```
G              D/F#             Em
but whose delight is in the law
       C         G
of the Lord,
      D/F#            Em
and who meditates on his
    C       D
law day and night.
```

## Chorus

```
C                    G
That person is like a tree
D/F#             Em
planted by streams of water,
C                G
which yields its fruit
     D/F#    Em
in season
     C            G
and whose leaf does not wither—
D/F#        Em
whatever they do
    C    D    G
prospers.
```

## Verse 3

```
G            D/F#          Em
Not so the wicked!
          C              G
They are like chaff
    D/F#       Em     C    D
that the wind blows away.
```

## Verse 4

```
G              D/F#           Em
Therefore the wicked will not stand
     C          G
in the judgment,
      D/F#            Em
nor sinners in the assembly
       C      D
of the righteous.
```

## Bridge

```
Em            C
For the Lord watches over
G              D/F#
the way of the righteous,
Em            C
but the way of the wicked
    G       D/F#    Em   C   D   G
leads to destruction.
