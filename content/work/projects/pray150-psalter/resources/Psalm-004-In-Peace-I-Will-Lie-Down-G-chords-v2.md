## Verse 1

```
G              D/F#             Em
Answer me when I call to you,
          C              G
my righteous God.
       D/F#           Em
Give me relief from my distress;
          C         D
have mercy on me and hear my prayer.
```

## Verse 2

```
G              D/F#             Em
How long will you people turn my glory
          C              G
into shame?
       D/F#           Em
How long will you love delusions
    C       D
and seek false gods?
```

## Chorus

```
C                    G
Know that the Lord has set apart
D/F#             Em
his faithful servant for himself;
C                G
the Lord hears when I
    D/F#    Em
call to him.
```

## Verse 3

```
G              D/F#             Em
Tremble and do not sin;
          C              G
when you are on your beds,
     D/F#              Em
search your hearts and be silent.
       C              D
Offer the sacrifices of the righteous
    G
and trust in the Lord.
```

## Verse 4

```
G              D/F#             Em
Many, Lord, are asking, "Who will bring us prosperity?"
          C              G
Let the light of your face shine on us.
     D/F#              Em
Fill my heart with joy when
       C       D
their grain and new wine abound.
```

## Bridge

```
C                    G
In peace I will lie down and sleep,
D/F#             Em
for you alone, Lord,
C         G       D/F#   Em    C    D    G
make me dwell in safety.

- Very gentle, contemplative feel - this is an evening prayer
- Strumming: Sparse, let chords ring - consider fingerpicking
- "For stringed instruments" - acoustic guitar should be featured
