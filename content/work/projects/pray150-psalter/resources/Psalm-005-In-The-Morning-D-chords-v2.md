## Verse 1

```
D              A/C#             Bm
Listen to my words, Lord,
          G              D
consider my lament.
     A/C#              Bm
Hear my cry for help,
          G              A
my King and my God,
    D
for to you I pray.
```

## Verse 2

```
D              A/C#             Bm
In the morning, Lord, you hear my voice;
          G              D
in the morning I lay my requests before you
     A/C#              Bm
and wait expectantly.
```

## Chorus

```
G                    D
For you are not a God who is pleased with wickedness;
A/C#             Bm
with you, evil people are not welcome.
G                    D
The arrogant cannot stand in your presence.
     A/C#    Bm
You hate all who do wrong;
G       D       A/C#   Bm
you destroy those who tell lies.
G    A    D
The bloodthirsty and deceitful
    G    A    Bm
you, Lord, detest.
```

## Verse 3

```
D              A/C#             Bm
But I, by your great love,
          G              D
can come into your house;
     A/C#              Bm
in reverence I bow down
          G              A
toward your holy temple.
```

## Verse 4

```
D              A/C#             Bm
Lead me, Lord, in your righteousness
          G              D
because of my enemies—
     A/C#              Bm
make your way straight before me.
       G              A
Not a word from their mouth can be trusted;
```

## Verse 5

```
Bm            G
their heart is filled with malice.
D              A/C#
Their throat is an open grave;
Bm            G
with their tongues they tell lies.
D              A/C#
Declare them guilty, O God!
     Bm              G
Let their intrigues be their downfall.
          A
Banish them for their many sins,
    D
for they have rebelled against you.
```

## Bridge

```
G                    D
But let all who take refuge in you be glad;
A/C#             Bm
let them ever sing for joy.
G              D
Spread your protection over them,
     A/C#    Bm
that those who love your name
G       A     D
may rejoice in you.
```

## Outro

```
G                    D
Surely, Lord, you bless the righteous;
A/C#             Bm
you surround them with your favor
G       A     D
as with a shield.

## Notes

- Capo: None
- Morning prayer psalm - fresh, expectant feel
- "For pipes" - light, airy instrumentation suggested
- The song moves from personal lament to confident trust
- Notice the contrast: God's judgment on wicked (Chorus) vs. blessing on righteous (Bridge/Outro)
- Build intensity through verses 4-5, then release into the joyful Bridge
