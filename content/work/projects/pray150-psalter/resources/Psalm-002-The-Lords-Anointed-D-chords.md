and the peoples plot in vain?
     A/C#              Bm
The kings of the earth rise up
          G              A

the Lord scoffs at them.

"I have installed my king
A/C#             Bm
on Zion, my holy mountain."
G                    D
I will proclaim the Lord's decree:
     A/C#    Bm
He said to me,
G       D       A/C#   Bm
"You are my son;
     G      A    D
today I have become your father.
```

D              A/C#             Bm
Ask me, and I will make the nations
       G         D
your inheritance,
      A/C#              Bm
the ends of the earth
       G       A
your possession.
         D          A/C#
You will break them with a
    Bm    G
rod of iron;
     D           A/C#
you will dash them to pieces
    Bm    G    A
like pottery."

be warned, you rulers of the earth.
      A/C#              Bm
Serve the Lord with fear
          G              A
and celebrate his rule with trembling.

Kiss his son, or he will be angry
D              A/C#
and your way will lead to your destruction,
Bm            G
for his wrath can flare up in a moment.
    D       A/C#    Bm   G
Blessed are all who take
