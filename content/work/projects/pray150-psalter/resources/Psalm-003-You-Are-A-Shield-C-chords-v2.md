## Verse 1

```
C              G/B              Am
Lord, how many are my foes!
          F              C
How many rise up against me!
     G/B              Am
Many are saying of me,
          F              G
"God will not deliver him."
```

## Verse 2

```
C              G/B              Am
But you, Lord, are a shield around me,
          F              C
my glory, the One who lifts my head high.
     G/B              Am
I call out to the Lord,
          F              G
and he answers me from his holy mountain.
```

## Chorus

```
F                    C
I lie down and sleep;
G/B              Am
I wake again, because the Lord
F         C
sustains me.
G/B              Am
I will not fear though tens of thousands
F              G
assail me on every side.
```

## Verse 3

```
C              G/B              Am
Arise, Lord! Deliver me, my God!
          F              C
Strike all my enemies on the jaw;
     G/B              Am
break the teeth of the wicked.
```

## Bridge

```
F                    C
From the Lord comes deliverance.
G/B              Am
May your blessing be on your people.
F       C      G/B    Am    F    G    C
May your blessing be on your people.
