## Primary Study: "Praying the Psalms" by N.T. Wright (2012)

**Video URL:** https://youtu.be/aSb62xG9om0  
**Full Title:** "Praying the Psalms, N. T. Wright"  
**Event:** 2012 Calvin Symposium on Worship - Plenary Address  
**Speaker:** Tom [N.T.] Wright  
**Duration:** Not specified (companion video is 1 hour, 7 minutes)  
**Views:** 68,603  
**Posted:** April 9, 2012

### Video Description
"Praying the Psalms: Personal, Pastoral, Theological and Liturgical Reflections - a plenary address by Tom [N.T.] Wright at the 2012 Calvin Symposium on Worship, sponsored by the Calvin Institute of Christian Worship. Wright presents a **New Testament perspective on the use of Psalms in Christian worship**."

### Key Moments (Timestamped Sections)
The video includes these chapter markers:

1. **Tom Wright** (0:02) - Introduction
2. **The Second Temple Jews** (4:02) - Historical context
3. **Why the Psalms Are Deeply Christological** (13:36) - Core theological argument
4. **Psalm 90** (16:53) - Specific psalm study
5. **Psalm 102** (17:28) - Specific psalm study
6. **Psalm 103** (17:49) - Specific psalm study
7. **Psalm 8** (20:39) - Specific psalm study
8. **Psalm 51** (21:39) - Specific psalm study

### Key Learning Points

#### 1. **The Psalms Are Deeply Christological**
This is Wright's central thesis (marked at 13:36). From a New Testament perspective, the Psalms are not just Hebrew poetry that Christians happen to use - they are fundamentally about Christ and read through Christ.

**Implication for Pray150:** Scott's vision aligns here - singing the Psalms is not about recovering an Old Testament practice, but about Christian prayer shaped by Jesus. The Psalms prepare us for and point us toward Christ.

#### 2. **Second Temple Jewish Context Matters**
Wright begins with the Second Temple period (4:02) - understanding how Jews between the Testaments used the Psalms informs how early Christians adopted them.

**Historical Connection:** Jesus and the apostles learned to pray the Psalms in this context. They inherited a living tradition of psalm-praying, not just ancient texts.

#### 3. **Personal, Pastoral, Theological, and Liturgical Dimensions**
The subtitle reveals Wright's framework - the Psalms work on multiple levels:
- **Personal:** Individual prayer life
- **Pastoral:** Caring for souls through scripture
- **Theological:** Deep doctrine embedded in poetry
- **Liturgical:** Corporate worship practice

**For Pray150:** A comprehensive Psalter can't just be hymnological - it must serve all four dimensions.

#### 4. **Specific Psalms Wright Focuses On**
- **Psalm 90:** Mortality, God's eternity, human frailty
- **Psalm 102:** Lament, suffering, hope
- **Psalm 103:** Praise, God's mercy and compassion
- **Psalm 8:** Human dignity, creation, God's glory
- **Psalm 51:** Confession, repentance, renewal

**Pattern:** Wright doesn't just discuss "happy" psalms - he includes lament (102) and penitence (51). The full emotional range is represented.

#### 5. **New Testament Scholarly Authority**
N.T. Wright is one of the world's most respected New Testament scholars. His endorsement of psalm-praying carries significant theological weight, especially for evangelicals who might dismiss psalms as "Old Testament law."

**Strategic Value:** Wright bridges academic scholarship and congregational practice - exactly what Pray150 needs to gain credibility.

### Key Learning Points from This Service

#### 1. **Structural Framework: Five Movements**
The service organizes psalms thematically:
1. God's Word (teaching)
2. God as Safe Place (refuge)
3. The Pit of Darkness (lament)
4. God's Faithful Love (thanksgiving)
5. God Who Deserves Praise (praise)

**For Pray150:** This is a brilliant organizing schema! It doesn't just group psalms by "type" (lament, praise, etc.) but by theological **posture** and **experience of God**.

#### 2. **Integration of Indigenous Voices**
The **First Nations Version** is used for all readings. Terry and Darlene Wildman lead original psalm songs. This isn't tokenism - it's theological: the Psalms speak in every culture's voice.

**For Pray150:** Scott's vision is cross-cultural. This model shows how to honor indigenous expressions without appropriation (Indigenous creators lead and compose).

#### 3. **Artist Reflections Create Space**
Anneke Kaai provides an "Artist's Reflection" before each section - creating contemplative space and visual/artistic interpretation alongside music and text.

**For Pray150:** Not just songs - the service includes **teaching moments** and **silence**. Worship isn't rushed.

#### 4. **Lament Gets Full Treatment**
Section III doesn't shy away from darkness:
- Silent prayer
- Prayer of lament
- Imprecatory psalms (58, 59, 60) - "O When Will We See Justice Done?"
- References Psalm 102 (one of the harshest lament psalms)

**Crucial Point:** The lament section is placed **in the middle**, not at the beginning or end. You dwell in darkness **between** safety and praise. This is liturgically and theologically sophisticated.

#### 5. **Musical Diversity Is Intentional**
- **Bellwether Arts:** Contemporary worship style (Sandra McCracken, Zac Hicks, etc.)
- **Celtic Psalms:** Traditional Irish/Scottish tunes with new texts
- **First Nations:** Indigenous musical sensibility
- **CICW Staff:** Classic hymn tune (KINGSFOLD)
- **Multilingual Doxology:** Global church voices

**For Pray150:** One psalter, many musical styles. Unity doesn't mean uniformity.

#### 6. **Psalm Prayers Frame Each Section**
After singing, there's a **spoken psalm prayer** - connecting sung praise to verbal intercession. This prevents psalms from being mere performance.

**For Pray150:** Singing isn't the endpoint. The psalm should move you to pray.

#### 7. **Copyright & Contemporary Composition**
Multiple recent compositions (2015-2025) show that psalm-singing is **living tradition**, not museum piece. New settings by:
- Sandra McCracken & Wendell Kimbrough
- Zac Hicks
- Mac Meador
- Kiran Young Wimberly
- Terry & Darlene Wildman
- Hope College Worship

**For Pray150:** Scott doesn't need to write all 150 settings himself - he can curate and commission from living composers.

#### 8. **First Nations Version As Translation**
This isn't just using Native American musical style - it's using a culturally-contextualized **Bible translation** (First Nations Version). The text itself is indigenous.

**Research Question:** What is the First Nations Version? Who created it? How does it handle Hebrew poetry? This deserves deeper study.

## Additional Recent Psalm Videos

### "Shaped by the Psalms: A Psalm Festival"
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EP8Or-JeMYI  
**Duration:** 1 hour, 52 minutes  
**Streamed:** February 6, 2026  
**Views:** 47

Another Friday Psalm Festival session, likely with similar structure. Need to watch for additional insights.

### "Thirsting for our Faithful God"
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzjSwOLw3mo  
**Duration:** 2 hours, 3 minutes  
**Streamed:** February 6, 2026  
**Views:** 32

Third session in the recent festival. The title suggests focus on refuge/longing psalms (possibly Psalm 42, 63, 84, etc.).

### "Psalm Singing and the Genevan Psalter"
**URL:** https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2sqvE1_NSik  
**Duration:** 1 hour, 8 minutes  
**Streamed:** 3 months ago (November 2025)  
**Views:** 1,200+

**Key Topic:** The historical **Genevan Psalter** - John Calvin's metrical psalter (1562), which set all 150 psalms to meter for congregational singing. This is the **Reformation model** for what Scott is attempting.

**Why This Matters:** The Genevan Psalter proves that **full-Psalter congregational singing is possible**. Calvin and his colleagues did it. This isn't a new idea - it's a renewal of a 16th-century practice.

**Research Priority:** HIGH. This video likely explains:
- How the Genevan Psalter was structured
- What tunes were used
- How it shaped Reformed worship
- Why it fell out of use
- How it's being recovered today

---

## Theological Themes Across Videos

### 1. **Psalms as Christian Prayer**
Both Wright's lectures and the festival services treat psalms as **Christian** prayer, not just Hebrew poetry. This is crucial for evangelical acceptance.

### 2. **Full Emotional Range**
Lament, penitence, praise, thanksgiving, wisdom - all present. No sanitizing.

### 3. **Christological Hermeneutic**
Wright's "deeply Christological" emphasis means psalms point to Christ, are prayed by Christ, and shape Christian identity.

### 4. **Corporate Over Individual**
These are worship services, not devotional aids. Psalms are for **the church gathered**, not just personal quiet times.

### 5. **Cultural Diversity as Theological Necessity**
Not just stylistic preference - the **global church** prays the psalms in culturally distinct ways because that's how the Spirit works.

### 6. **Historical Recovery + Contemporary Creation**
Both/and: honor Genevan Psalter **and** commission new settings. Tradition and innovation together.

## Strategic Insights for Pray150

### What Scott Is Doing Right
1. **All 150 Psalms** - CICW does thematic collections; Scott's comprehensive vision is unique
2. **Accessible to Small Churches** - CICW has institutional resources; Scott is DIY/grassroots
3. **Free Church Context** - CICW is mainline/Reformed; Scott bridges to evangelical/Baptist world
4. **Theological Framework (95 Theses)** - Scott has articulated "why" in ways CICW assumes

### What Scott Can Learn
1. **Thematic Groupings** - The five-movement structure (Word, Safe Place, Darkness, Love, Praise) could organize Pray150 liturgically
2. **Commission Composers** - Don't write all 150 himself; curate and commission
3. **Multiple Musical Styles** - One project can include contemporary, traditional, Celtic, gospel, etc.
4. **Artist Reflections** - Include teaching/devotional content alongside songs
5. **Lament in the Middle** - Placement matters liturgically
6. **Cultural Humility** - Collaborate with Indigenous, African American, Latino/a creators
7. **Psalm Prayers** - Include spoken prayers shaped by each psalm

### Competitive Landscape
CICW represents the **institutional/academic** approach to psalm renewal. They have:
- University backing
- Grant funding (Lilly Endowment)
- 27+ years of history
- Scholarly credibility (N.T. Wright, etc.)
- Publishing partnerships

Scott's **Pray150** offers:
- Grassroots/organic approach
- Free church accessibility
- Complete 150-psalm vision (not just selections)
- Theological urgency ("95 Theses" manifesto)
- Digital-first, permission-free distribution

**Not competition - complementary.** CICW provides scholarly foundation; Pray150 provides practical tool.

## Next Steps for Research

1. **Watch full N.T. Wright lectures** - extract detailed theological arguments
2. **Study Genevan Psalter video** - understand historical model
3. **Research First Nations Version** - who, what, where to get it
4. **Explore Bellwether Arts catalog** - find their full psalm settings
5. **Check Hymnary.org** - map existing psalm settings comprehensively
6. **Contact CICW directly** - ask about their "Dwelling in the Psalms" year-long initiative
7. **Find written materials** - are there articles or books from this research?
