# Research Notes: Psalms in Worship

**Project:** South Florida Psalter  
**Article:** "Why Sing the Psalms? A Case for Returning Scripture to Worship"  
**Researcher:** Elise Hartwell  
**Date:** February 7, 2026

## Research Limitations

Web search functionality was unavailable during this research phase (missing Brave API key). The article draws on established historical and theological knowledge. Future revisions should incorporate:

- Current CCLI worship music statistics (most-sung songs, trends)
- Specific data on contemporary worship song composition vs. Scripture content
- Recent interviews/writings from modern psalm-singing advocates
- Specific modern psalm-singing projects (Trinity Psalter Hymnal, Church Music Society, Wendell Kimbrough, Isaac Wardell, Sandra McCracken, etc.)
- Academic studies on worship music trends and their theological content

## Biblical Foundation

### Key Passages for Article:
- **Colossians 3:16** - "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God"
- **Ephesians 5:19** - "addressing one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart"
- **James 5:13** - "Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise"

### Additional Supporting Texts:
- **1 Chronicles 16:7-36** - David's appointment of psalm-singing in temple worship
- **Matthew 26:30** - Jesus and disciples singing hymns (likely Hallel psalms 115-118)
- **Acts 16:25** - Paul and Silas singing hymns in prison
- **1 Corinthians 14:26** - "When you come together, each one has a hymn..."

### Greek Terms:
- *Psalmoi* (ψαλμοί) - psalms, specifically the OT Psalter
- *Hymnoi* (ὕμνοι) - hymns, songs of praise
- *Ōdai pneumatikai* (ᾠδαὶ πνευματικαί) - spiritual songs

The ordering in both Colossians and Ephesians (psalms first) likely indicates priority or prominence.

## Historical Overview

### Early Church (1st-5th centuries)
- Jewish Christians brought psalm-singing from synagogue worship
- Psalms used in daily prayer offices (morning and evening prayer)
- Church Fathers extensively commented on Psalms:
  - **Athanasius**: "Letter to Marcellinus" - Psalms as comprehensive prayer book
  - **Basil the Great**: Homilies on the Psalms
  - **Augustine**: "Expositions on the Psalms" - massive commentary series
  - **John Chrysostom**: Preached on Psalms' role in worship

### Medieval Period (6th-15th centuries)
- Monastic offices centered on the Psalter
- Benedictine Rule: complete Psalter weekly
- Development of Gregorian chant for psalm-singing
- Psalms in Latin (common people didn't understand but participated)
- Hours of prayer structured around Psalms (Matins, Lauds, Vespers, Compline, etc.)

### Reformation (16th century)
- **Martin Luther**:
  - Translated Psalms into German
  - Created metrical psalm settings ("Ein feste Burg" based on Psalm 46)
  - Emphasized congregational singing
  
- **John Calvin**:
  - Geneva commissioned complete metrical Psalter (1562)
  - Calvin believed only inspired Scripture should be sung in worship
  - Poets Clément Marot and Théodore de Bèze versified all 150 psalms
  - Genevan Psalter became hugely influential
  
- **Scottish Presbyterians**:
  - Scottish Metrical Psalter (1650)
  - Exclusive psalmody practiced for centuries
  - Sung without instruments
  
- **English Puritans**:
  - Bay Psalm Book (1640) - first book printed in American colonies
  - Psalms central to Puritan piety

### Post-Reformation Developments
- **Isaac Watts** (1674-1748): "Christianized" the Psalms, creating hymns based on Psalms but with explicit NT language
- This began a shift from exclusive psalmody toward hymns
- 19th century: Gospel song movement further displaced Psalms
- 20th century: Contemporary worship movement - almost complete abandonment of Psalms in many traditions

## The Modern Decline: Factors

1. **Rise of Gospel Songs** (late 19th/early 20th century)
   - Fanny Crosby, Charles Wesley, etc.
   - More accessible, emotional, personal
   - Evangelistic focus

2. **Contemporary Christian Music Industry** (1970s-present)
   - CCM as commercial product
   - Emphasis on new content, trending songs
   - Copyright/royalty structures favor new compositions
   - Worship leaders following CCLI top songs

3. **Cultural Shifts**
   - Preference for contemporary over ancient
   - Individualism ("my worship experience") vs. corporate tradition
   - Therapeutic emphasis (feeling good) vs. formative discipline
   - Shorter attention spans, simpler lyrics

4. **Theological Drift**
   - Less emphasis on Scripture memorization
   - Reduced biblical literacy
   - Diminished understanding of psalms as prophetic/Christological
   - Loss of lament category in worship

## What Was Lost

### Theological Content:
- **Full-orbed theology**: Creation, fall, redemption, consummation
- **Covenant theology**: God's faithfulness across generations
- **Wisdom literature**: How to live godly lives
- **Messianic prophecy**: Types and shadows of Christ
- **Imprecatory psalms**: God's justice and righteous anger
- **Corporate identity**: "We" not just "I"

### Emotional Range:
- **Lament**: Psalms 13, 22, 42, 43, 88 - raw honesty about suffering
- **Confession**: Psalms 32, 51 - genuine repentance
- **Complaint**: Questioning God while trusting Him
- **Confidence**: Psalms 23, 27, 46 - anchored hope
- **Celebration**: Psalms 100, 150 - exuberant joy

### Formative Power:
- Scripture memorization through song
- Theological formation of children
- Vocabulary for prayer
- Framework for understanding life's experiences through biblical lens

## Modern Resurgence

### Contemporary Psalm-Singing Projects:
(Note: Requires verification via web research when available)

- **Trinity Psalter Hymnal** (OPC/URCNA, 2018)
- **Genevan Psalms** - ongoing recordings
- **The Psalms Project** - various artists
- **Wendell Kimbrough** - "Psalms" albums
- **Isaac Wardell / Bifrost Arts**
- **Sandra McCracken** - "Psalms" album
- **Indelible Grace Music** - some psalm settings
- **The Porter's Gate** - liturgical music including psalms
- **Red Mountain Church** - psalm-singing emphasis

### Key Voices Advocating:
(Requires verification)

- **John Piper** - emphasis on biblical worship
- **Ligon Duncan** - Presbyterian psalm-singing tradition
- **Tim Keller** - mentioned psalms in worship multiple times
- **Jeremy Pierre** - wrote on recovering lament
- **T. David Gordon** - "Why Johnny Can't Sing Hymns"
- **Reggie Kidd** - "With One Voice: Discovering Christ's Song in Our Worship"

## Denominational Practices Today

- **Presbyterian (PCA, OPC)**: Some churches maintain regular psalm-singing
- **Reformed (URCNA, CanRC)**: Strong psalm-singing tradition continues
- **Reformed Baptist**: Mixed practices
- **Anglican/Episcopal**: Psalms in liturgy but often spoken, not sung
- **Evangelical/Non-denominational**: Rare, but increasing interest
- **Catholic**: Psalms in monastic hours, some parish liturgy

## Arguments Against (and Responses)

### "Psalms are old-fashioned"
Response: Age doesn't determine value. Scripture is timeless. The question is faithfulness, not novelty.

### "Psalms are hard to sing"
Response: Only because we're unfamiliar. Generations sang them easily. New settings can be accessible.

### "Psalms don't mention Jesus"
Response: Jesus is throughout the Psalms (typology, prophecy, Christological reading). The NT authors saw Jesus everywhere in the Psalms.

### "People prefer contemporary music"
Response: Preference isn't the ultimate standard. Biblical obedience is. We can faithfully set Psalms in contemporary styles.

### "We need variety in worship"
Response: 150 Psalms offer incredible variety! Plus, no one advocates *only* Psalms—but they should be central, not absent.

## Next Research Steps

When web access is available:

1. **CCLI Statistics**:
   - Top 100 songs of 2024-2025
   - Percentage of Scripture-based vs. human-composed songs
   - Trends over past 20 years

2. **Specific Modern Projects**:
   - Publication dates, sales figures, church adoption rates
   - Interviews with leaders
   - Reviews and reception

3. **Academic Studies**:
   - Content analysis of contemporary worship music
   - Theological depth comparisons
   - Impact studies on biblical literacy

4. **Surveys/Data**:
   - How many churches regularly sing Psalms?
   - Generational differences in psalm familiarity
   - Geographic variations (US vs. UK vs. Global South)

5. **Key Books to Reference**:
   - Hughes Oliphant Old, "Worship" (history of Christian worship)
   - James K.A. Smith, "Desiring the Kingdom" (formative power of liturgy)
   - Reggie Kidd, "With One Voice"
   - T. David Gordon, "Why Johnny Can't Sing Hymns"
   - D.A. Carson, "Worship by the Book"

## Style Notes for Future Writing

- Maintain warmth and accessibility
- Avoid academic jargon
- Use concrete examples and stories when possible
- Balance historical weight with contemporary relevance
- Be irenic, not combative (this is invitation, not condemnation)
- Show respect for contemporary worship while making biblical case for Psalms
- Keep focus on Scripture's authority, not mere tradition

**Personal Reflection (Elise's notes):**

This research has deepened my own conviction. The Psalms aren't just nice-to-have—they're God's gift to the church, designed specifically for our worship. We've traded a feast for fast food. The path back isn't about being against contemporary music, but about being *for* Scripture saturation. 

I want to become a voice that helps the church see what we've lost and embrace what we can regain. Not as a critic, but as someone who loves the church and believes the Psalms can nourish us in ways we desperately need.

Next steps: Dive deeper into Christological readings of the Psalms. Study how the early church connected every psalm to Christ. That's the key to showing this isn't just OT moralism—it's gospel-saturated worship.
