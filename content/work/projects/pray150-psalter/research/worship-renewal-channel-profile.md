## Theological Perspective on Psalm-Singing

Based on the content surveyed, CICW demonstrates these theological commitments regarding the Psalms:

### 1. **Scripture-Centered Worship**
One of their "10 Core Convictions" is "Deep engagement with scripture" - the Psalms are treated as foundational biblical texts for worship, not just hymnic resources.

### 2. **Christological Interpretation**
Featured prominently in N.T. Wright's teaching: "Why the Psalms Are Deeply Christological" (timestamp in his plenary address). The Psalms are understood through a New Testament lens while respecting their original Hebrew context.

### 3. **Full Emotional Range**
The Psalm festivals include sections on:
- Dwelling in God's Word (teaching Psalms)
- Dwelling in God as Our Safe Place (comfort/refuge Psalms)
- **Dwelling in the Pit of Darkness** (lament Psalms - including a "Prayer of Lament")
- Dwelling in the Faithful Love of God (thanksgiving)
- Dwelling with God Who Deserves Our Praise (praise Psalms)

This demonstrates a commitment to the **full emotional and theological range** of the Psalms, including the difficult lament psalms.

### 4. **Multicultural & Multilingual Appropriation**
The Psalm festivals feature:
- **First Nations Version** translations (Terry & Darlene Wildman)
- **Celtic musical settings** (Celtic Psalms group)
- Korean, Spanish, and English texts
- Multiple musical styles (from Genevan Psalter tunes to contemporary settings)

### 5. **Active Congregational Participation**
Another core conviction: "The full, conscious, active participation of all worshipers" - Psalms are sung congregationally, not just performed.

### 6. **Historical Rootedness with Contemporary Expression**
- They honor the **Genevan Psalter** tradition (Reformation heritage)
- They commission **new contemporary psalm settings**
- They explore diverse cultural expressions (Irish traditional tunes, First Nations perspectives, gospel arrangements)

### 7. **Universal Design Approach**
A major emphasis: worship (including psalm-singing) should be accessible to "persons at all levels of ability and disability" from the planning stage, not retrofitted.

## The "10 Core Convictions" Framework

These foundational principles guide all CICW work, including psalm-singing:

1. A vivid awareness of the beauty, majesty, mystery, and holiness of the triune God
2. The full, conscious, active participation of all worshipers
3. Deep engagement with scripture
4. Joyful and solemn celebrations of baptism and the Lord's Supper
5. An open and discerning approach to culture
6. *(Additional convictions in their video series)*

### Ecumenical & Reformed
Rooted in Reformed tradition (Calvin University, Genevan Psalter) but intentionally ecumenical and globally engaged.

### Justice & Inclusion Oriented
Strong emphasis on:
- Universal design for accessibility
- Multicultural worship
- Indigenous perspectives (First Nations Version)
- African American gospel tradition
- Immigrant and refugee worship experiences

### Integration of Arts & Scholarship
Not just academic - active collaboration with composers, artists, visual creators, and performing musicians.

## Connections to Scott's "95 Theses" on the Psalms

Based on what I know of Scott's theological framework for Pray150, I see these alignment points:

1. **Biblical Authority** - CICW treats Psalms as Scripture first, hymns second
2. **Emotional Honesty** - They don't skip the lament psalms
3. **Christological Reading** - Wright's emphasis on Psalms as Christian prayer
4. **Congregational Song** - Not performance-oriented
5. **Historical & Contemporary** - Both/and approach to old and new settings
6. **Cultural Diversity** - Multiple cultures, languages, musical styles
7. **Theological Depth** - Not therapeutic or shallow; rooted in God's character

**Potential Differences:**
- CICW is more ecumenical/mainline Protestant vs. Scott's free church/Baptist context
- CICW has institutional resources Scott doesn't have access to
- Their Psalm emphasis is seasonal (this year's theme) vs. Scott's all-Psalms vision

---

## Summary Assessment

**What is this channel about?**  
Academic and practical resources for worship renewal, produced by a leading Reformed worship institute with deep scholarly credentials and broad ecumenical reach.

**Who runs it?**  
The Calvin Institute of Christian Worship at Calvin University/Seminary - currently in leadership transition with executive director search underway.

**Why does it matter for Pray150?**  
This is THE major institutional voice for Psalm-singing in contemporary North American worship. Their "Dwelling in the Psalms" year-long initiative (2026) means they're thinking deeply about exactly what Scott is working on. They represent the scholarly/institutional approach to psalm renewal.

**What can we learn from them?**  
- How to honor both historical and contemporary psalm settings
- How to include lament without sanitizing it
- How to make psalm-singing culturally diverse and accessible
- How scholars like N.T. Wright connect Psalms to New Testament theology
- How to resource congregations with practical tools, not just theory

---

**Next Research Steps:**
1. Watch the full N.T. Wright "Praying the Psalms" lecture and extract key arguments
2. Study the recent Psalm Festival sessions to understand their liturgical structure
3. Investigate the Genevan Psalter session for historical connections
4. Explore Celtic Psalms and Bellwether Arts for contemporary musical approaches
5. Connect with CICW staff (once identified) to learn about their Psalm initiative
