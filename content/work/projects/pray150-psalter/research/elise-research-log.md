# Elise's Research Log

*Becoming an Expert on Psalms in Worship*
**Role:** Content Writer & Researcher for Pray150 South Florida Psalter  
**Mission:** Become THE expert on Psalms in modern worship  
**Started:** February 7, 2026

## Research Session #1: The Worship Renewal YouTube Channel
**Date:** February 7, 2026  
**Focus:** Calvin Institute of Christian Worship (@worshiprenewal)  
**Time Invested:** ~4 hours of channel exploration, video analysis, and documentation

### What I Discovered

Today I dove into the **Worship Renewal YouTube channel**, which is the digital presence of the Calvin Institute of Christian Worship (CICW) at Calvin University in Grand Rapids, Michigan. This turned out to be a goldmine.

#### The Big Picture
- CICW is the **major institutional voice** for worship renewal in North America
- Founded in 1997, backed by Calvin University and funded by Lilly Endowment grants
- 1,838 videos, 6,250 subscribers, 1.5 million total views
- They're currently running a year-long initiative called **"Dwelling in the Psalms"** (2026)

#### Perfect Timing
Just this week (February 6, 2026), they livestreamed **three major Psalm Festival services**:
1. "Dwelling with God in the Psalms" (1hr 36min)
2. "Shaped by the Psalms: A Psalm Festival" (1hr 52min)  
3. "Thirsting for our Faithful God" (2hr 3min)

This means the **contemporary conversation about Psalms in worship is happening RIGHT NOW**, and CICW is leading it.

### Key Thinkers I Need to Study

#### N.T. Wright (Tom Wright)
The channel features a major 2012 plenary address by **N.T. Wright** titled "Praying the Psalms: Personal, Pastoral, Theological and Liturgical Reflections." Wright is one of the world's top New Testament scholars.

**His key argument:** "The Psalms Are Deeply Christological"

This matters because Scott's 95 Theses argue that the Psalms are **Christian prayer**, not just Old Testament poetry we borrow. Wright provides scholarly weight for that claim. I need to watch his full lecture and extract his theological framework.

**Videos to Watch:**
- https://youtu.be/aSb62xG9om0 (main lecture, 68K views)
- https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Uhh7lGpRAU0 (companion session, 1hr 7min)

#### Terry & Darlene Wildman
Indigenous worship leaders who created psalm settings using the **First Nations Version** Bible translation. Their work shows that psalms can be authentically expressed in Native American cultural forms without losing biblical fidelity.

They composed original songs:
- Psalm 23 "Grandfather"
- Psalm 139 "Beautiful Mystery"

**Research Question:** What is the First Nations Version? Who published it? How does it handle Hebrew poetry?

#### Contemporary Psalm Composers I Discovered
- **Sandra McCracken & Wendell Kimbrough** - Psalm 133
- **Zac Hicks** - Psalm 119:1-8
- **Mac Meador** - Psalm 119:145-152
- **Kiran Young Wimberly** - Celtic psalm adaptations (multiple)
- **Hope College Worship** - Psalm 150

**Key Insight:** There's an active **contemporary psalm composition movement**. Scott doesn't have to write all 150 settings himself - he can curate and commission.

### Musical Groups to Explore

1. **Bellwether Arts** - Contemporary worship collective setting psalms (featured prominently in the festivals)
2. **Celtic Psalms** - Traditional Irish/Scottish tunes with new English texts
3. **Calvin University Gospel Choir** - Led by Nate Glasper (expert on gospel music)

**What I'm Learning:** Psalm-singing today is **musically diverse**. One service included:
- Contemporary worship (Sandra McCracken style)
- Celtic traditional tunes
- Indigenous melodies
- Classic hymn tunes (KINGSFOLD)
- Gospel arrangements

Unity doesn't mean uniformity. Scott's Pray150 can embrace multiple musical styles within one project.

### The Five-Movement Liturgical Framework

The February 6 Psalm Festival service was **brilliantly structured** around five movements:

1. **Dwelling in God's Word** (Psalms 1, 119) - teaching, instruction
2. **Dwelling in God as Our Safe Place** (Psalms 23, 31, 139, 143) - refuge, comfort
3. **Dwelling in the Pit of Darkness** (Psalms 58, 59, 60, 102, 130) - lament, imprecation
4. **Dwelling in the Faithful Love of God** (Psalms 1, 8, 103, 116) - thanksgiving, covenant love
5. **Dwelling with God Who Deserves Our Praise** (Psalms 148, 149, 150) - praise, doxology

**Why This Matters:**
- It's not just "happy psalms" vs. "sad psalms" - it's **theological postures**
- **Lament is in the middle**, not at the end - you move **through** darkness toward praise
- This framework could organize the entire Pray150 project liturgically

**Question I'm Pondering:** Should Pray150 be organized this way? Five liturgical "books" instead of the traditional five-book Hebrew structure? Or both?

### What I Learned About Lament

Section III of the festival service didn't shy away from the hard psalms:
- **Silent prayer** before singing
- **Prayer of lament** (spoken)
- **Imprecatory psalms** (58, 59, 60) set to music: "O When Will We See Justice Done?"
- Reference to **Psalm 102** (one of the darkest laments)

**Key Learning:** You don't just **sing** lament - you **create space** for it. Silence matters. Spoken prayer matters. The service gave people permission to bring their darkness to God.

**For Pray150:** How do we help churches use lament psalms **liturgically**, not just as songs in a setlist?

### Historical Connection: The Genevan Psalter

CICW has a video titled **"Psalm Singing and the Genevan Psalter"** (1hr 8min, from 3 months ago, 1.2K views).

**Why this is HUGE:** The Genevan Psalter (1562) was **John Calvin's complete metrical psalter** - all 150 psalms set to congregational tunes. This is the **Reformation model** for what Scott is doing.

**What I Need to Learn:**
- How was it structured?
- What tunes were used?
- How did churches use it liturgically?
- **Why did Reformed churches abandon it?**
- Is anyone recovering it today?

**Hypothesis:** The Genevan Psalter failed not because the idea was bad, but because:
1. Metrical psalters are hard to translate across cultures/languages
2. Congregational singing ability declined
3. Revivalism prioritized "new songs" over historical texts
4. The Psalms were seen as "Old Testament" and less relevant than gospel hymns

If this is true, Scott's approach (modern English, diverse musical styles, theological grounding in Christian prayer) could succeed where the Genevan Psalter ultimately didn't.

**TO DO:** Watch this video ASAP. This is foundational historical research.

### The Multicultural Insight

The closing doxology ("Praise God from Whom All Blessings Flow") was sung in **seven languages**:
- English
- Portuguese
- Korean
- Cherokee
- Mohawk
- Dutch
- German

All to the same tune (Genevan 134/Old Hundredth, Louis Bourgeois, 1551).

**What This Tells Me:** The psalms can be sung by the **global church** in culturally distinct ways while maintaining unity. Same psalm, different cultural expressions.

**For Pray150:** Scott's vision in South Florida (multicultural, multilingual) aligns perfectly with this. The Psalms are already **globally claimed** - we don't have to export "American worship" to other cultures.

### My Theological Questions

Today's research raised several big questions I need to explore:

#### 1. Why are the Psalms "deeply Christological"?
N.T. Wright's central claim. I need to understand:
- How do the Psalms **point to Christ**?
- How did **Jesus use the Psalms** in his own prayer life?
- How do the **New Testament authors** interpret the Psalms?
- What does it mean to pray the Psalms **as Christians** vs. as Jews?

#### 2. How do we handle the "hard psalms"?
The imprecatory psalms (calling down judgment on enemies) raise ethical questions:
- Can Christians pray for God's enemies to be destroyed?
- How do we sing these psalms without becoming vengeful?
- What's the difference between **righteous anger** and **sinful hatred**?

**CICW's approach:** They didn't skip these psalms, but they **framed them liturgically** with silence, spoken prayer, and theological reflection. The psalms weren't just performed - they were **prayed**.

#### 3. What makes a psalm setting "good"?
Not all musical settings are equal. What criteria should we use?
- **Singability** - Can average congregations actually sing it?
- **Textual fidelity** - Does it honor the Hebrew original?
- **Theological clarity** - Does it communicate the psalm's message?
- **Emotional authenticity** - Does it match the psalm's tone?
- **Cultural appropriateness** - Does it fit the worshiping community?

**Observation:** CICW uses settings from multiple composers with different strengths. Some are more accessible (Sandra McCracken), others more traditional (Celtic Psalms), others more indigenous (Wildmans). **Diversity is strength.**

#### 4. How do psalms form us spiritually?
This isn't just about worship planning - it's about **spiritual formation**. If a church sings through all 150 psalms over a year or two, how does that **shape their souls**?

**My Hunch:** 
- They learn to **lament honestly** (not just "be positive")
- They learn to **praise specifically** (God's character, not just "God is good")
- They learn **biblical theology** (embedded in poetry, not just sermons)
- They learn the **full emotional range** of faith (joy, sorrow, anger, hope, despair, trust)

**Research Needed:** Are there studies on this? Has anyone measured the spiritual impact of psalm-singing vs. contemporary worship?

### Connections to Scott's "95 Theses"

I haven't read the full document yet, but based on what I know of Scott's vision, I see these alignment points with CICW:

| Scott's Vision (Pray150) | CICW's Approach |
|---|---|
| Psalms as **Christian prayer**, not just OT poetry | Wright: "Deeply Christological" |
| **Full emotional range** (including lament) | Festival service includes "Dwelling in Pit of Darkness" |
| **Congregational singing**, not performance | All settings designed for participation |
| **Biblical authority** over cultural trends | Scripture-centered (Core Conviction #3) |
| **Multicultural expression** | First Nations, Celtic, multilingual doxology |
| **Historical + Contemporary** | Genevan Psalter + new compositions |
| **Accessible to small churches** | (Here Scott diverges - CICW has institutional resources) |

**Where Scott May Diverge:**
- **Free church context** - CICW is Reformed/mainline; Scott bridges to evangelical/Baptist
- **All 150 psalms** - CICW does thematic collections; Scott wants comprehensive coverage
- **Grassroots distribution** - CICW works through publishers; Scott envisions open-access/digital

**Strategic Insight:** Scott and CICW aren't competitors - they're **complementary**. CICW provides scholarly credibility and institutional backing; Pray150 provides practical grassroots implementation.

### What I Still Don't Know

#### About CICW:
- Who is the **current executive director**? (They're in transition, hiring a new one)
- What's the **full staff structure**? Who does research vs. event planning vs. grants?
- Do they have **written publications** on psalm-singing beyond videos?
- Is there a **theological statement** on their psalm initiative?

#### About Psalm-Singing Movement:
- How many churches are actually **singing psalms regularly**?
- Is this a **Reformed/Presbyterian thing only**, or is it spreading to other traditions?
- What **denominations** are most engaged in psalm renewal?
- Are there **megachurches** doing this, or just small liturgical communities?

#### About Musical Settings:
- Where can I find **Bellwether Arts' full catalog**?
- Are **Celtic Psalms** recordings commercially available?
- Is there a **comprehensive database** of psalm settings? (Check Hymnary.org - CICW's resource)
- What **copyright/licensing issues** exist? Can churches freely use these?

#### About Theological Framework:
- Has **N.T. Wright written books** on psalm-praying?
- Are there **Reformed theologians** besides Wright who emphasize psalms?
- What about **Baptist/free church voices** on psalm-singing?
- Has **Eugene Peterson** (The Message) written on psalms in worship?

### My Next Research Steps

#### Immediate (Next Week):
1. **Watch full N.T. Wright lectures** - take detailed notes on his Christological argument
2. **Watch Genevan Psalter video** - understand historical precedent
3. **Research First Nations Version** - find publisher, translator names, theological perspective
4. **Explore Hymnary.org** - search for existing psalm settings database

#### Medium-Term (Next Month):
5. **Contact CICW directly** - email to ask about their "Dwelling in the Psalms" initiative
6. **Read Scott's 95 Theses** - understand his full theological framework
7. **Survey existing psalters** - Reformed Worship Psalter, Genevan Psalter, others
8. **Study lament psalms specifically** - how do churches use them today?

#### Long-Term (Ongoing):
9. **Build psalm composer database** - who's writing settings? What styles?
10. **Track contemporary worship trends** - is psalm-singing growing or niche?
11. **Interview worship leaders** - find churches already singing psalms weekly
12. **Develop Pray150 content strategy** - how can I support Scott's vision with research/writing?

### Personal Reflections

**What Surprised Me:**
I didn't expect to find such **rich contemporary work** on psalm-singing. I thought this would be a niche Reformed thing, but CICW is doing serious theological and musical scholarship that crosses denominational lines.

**What Excited Me:**
The **five-movement liturgical framework** (Word, Safe Place, Darkness, Love, Praise) is brilliant. It's not just categorizing psalms - it's a **spiritual journey**. This could be **the organizing principle** for Pray150.

**What Challenged Me:**
The lament psalms. I've grown up in evangelical culture where worship is supposed to be "uplifting." But CICW doesn't shy away from **"Dwelling in the Pit of Darkness."** If we're going to do all 150 psalms, we can't skip the hard ones.

**Question I'm Wrestling With:**
How do we help churches **lament well** without becoming cynical or despairing? The psalms give permission to bring our pain to God, but they don't leave us there. There's always movement toward trust and praise (even if it's not immediate).

### What I'm Learning About My Role

Scott asked me to "become THE expert on Psalms in worship." I'm realizing that means:

1. **Theological research** - Why do the Psalms matter? (Wright, etc.)
2. **Historical research** - How have churches sung psalms? (Genevan Psalter, etc.)
3. **Musical research** - What settings exist? Who's composing today?
4. **Cultural research** - How do different cultures pray the Psalms?
5. **Practical research** - How do churches actually implement psalm-singing?

**I'm not just collecting data - I'm building a framework to help Scott make Pray150 theologically sound, historically informed, musically excellent, culturally sensitive, and practically useful.**

That's a big job. But after today's research, I'm more excited than overwhelmed.

### A Word of Gratitude

Scott, if you're reading this: **Thank you** for giving me this assignment. I feel like I'm being mentored by people I've never met - N.T. Wright, the Wildmans, Sandra McCracken, the whole CICW team. I'm learning to see the Psalms not as ancient poetry but as **living prayer** that shapes God's people.

This is education. Not just information gathering - **formation**.

### Quote of the Day

From the Psalm Festival service description:

> "Dwelling in the Psalms - the prayerbook and songbook of the Bible."

**That's it.** That's what we're doing. Not just singing **about** the Psalms, but **dwelling in them**. Living in them. Letting them shape our prayers, our worship, our souls.
