### The Psalms are Prayers

The Psalter is the Prayer book of the Bible.

> Psalm 72:20 — "This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse."

These prayers are powerful!

> Psalm 29:11a — "The Lord gives strength to His people"

> 1 Samuel 16:23 — "Whenever the spirit from God came on Saul, David would take up his lyre and play. Then relief would come to Saul; he would feel better, and the evil spirit would leave him."

> Dietrich Bonhoeffer: "Whenever the Psalter is abandoned, an incomparable treasure vanishes from the Christian church. With its recovery will come unsuspected power."

It is remarkable that Scripture (the Word of God) contains prayers (words directed to God). Therefore, through the Psalms, God teaches His people how to pray.

The disciples of Jesus asked "Lord, teach us to pray." In response, Jesus gave us the 'Lord's Prayer.' So, it follows that the Lord's Prayer stands in relation to all biblical prayer (the Psalms specifically) in the same way that the Two Greatest Commandments stand in relation to the Law and the Prophets ("All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments" - Mt. 22:40).

> Martin Luther: "It [the Psalter] penetrates the Lord's Prayer and the Lord's Prayer penetrates it, so that it is possible to understand one on the basis of the other and to bring them into joyful harmony."

The Psalms are designed for both corporate worship and personal daily prayer. The practice of praying the Psalms publicly and personally is an exercise in reframing all of life toward the Gospel of Jesus Christ.

### On Human Prayer and Its Limitations

God created all people with the capacity/ability to pray (innate desire and longing, made to worship).

> Matthew 6:5,7: "When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites…do not keep on babbling like pagans…"

However, fallen humans (separated from the presence of God) do not innately/automatically know how or what to pray.

> Dietrich Bonhoeffer: "We confuse wishes, hopes, sighs, laments, rejoicing–all of which the heart can do by itself–with prayer."

### The Psalms as Songs

The Psalms were written with the express intent of becoming songs (To the choirmaster, musical terms, Psalm 47:6-7).

The native habitat of the Psalms is in music, and throughout history they have been sung to many tunes. The lyrics are inspired, but there is no 'codified' music. Musical styles and tastes vary from generation to generation and from culture to culture.

Therefore, integral to the missional heart of God, there is an expectation that every new culture and generation will sing the Psalms "with a new song."

> Psalm 96:1-3: "Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth. Sing to the Lord, praise his name; proclaim his salvation day after day. Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all peoples."

> Martin Luther: "Ah, there is not the juice, the strength, the passion, the fire which I find in the Psalter. It tastes too cold and too hard." (on non-inspired prayers)

> John Calvin: "When we have looked thoroughly, and searched here and there, we shall not find better songs nor more fitting for the purpose [of worship], than the Psalms of David, which the Holy Spirit spoke and made through Him."

Whoever has begun to pray the Psalter in earnest with regularity will begin to lose interest in non-inspired, 'privately composed' prayers, hymns, and songs.

### Authorship

The Psalms were written by a variety of authors:

- **David**: Specifically noted as the author of 73 psalms (Psalms 3–9; 11–32; 34–41; 51–65; 68–70; 86; 101; 103; 108–110; 122; 124; 131; 133; 138–145). Plus Psalm 2 and 95 attributed by NT writers.
- **Asaph** (David's head musician): 12 psalms (50, 73–83)
- **Sons of Korah** (Levitical family): 11 psalms (42, 44–49, 84–85, 87–88). Heman the Ezrahite named in Psalm 88. Psalm 43 likely also theirs.
- **Solomon**: 2 psalms (72, 127)
- **Moses**: 1 psalm (90)
- **Ethan the Ezrahite**: 1 psalm (89)
- **50 "Orphan Psalms"**: No author mentioned, but David may have written many

Because so many were written by David and his close associates, the entirety of the Psalter has been considered decisively bound up with the name of David.

> 2 Samuel 23:1 — David was known as the "sweet psalmist of Israel"

### David as Prototype of Christ

David is a prototype of Jesus Christ. The events of his life and his experience of these events point forward to the One who will proceed from him.

> Acts 2:30-31 — "He was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. Seeing what was to come, he spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah."

Christ prayed these prayers through the original authors.

> Hebrews 2:11-12 — "Both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters. He says, 'I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters; in the assembly I will sing your praises.'" [quoting Psalm 22:22]

> 2 Samuel 23:1-2 — "The Spirit of the Lord spoke through me; his word was on my tongue."

> 2 Timothy 3:16 — "All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness."

### Jesus Prayed the Psalms

Jesus directly quotes the Psalms throughout His ministry:

- Matthew 5:5 — quotes Psalm 37:11 ("the meek will inherit the earth")
- Matthew 7:23, Luke 13:27 — quotes Psalm 6:8 ("Away from me, you evildoers!")
- Matthew 21:16 — quotes Psalm 8:2 ("Out of the mouth of infants...")
- Matthew 21:42, Mark 12:10-11, Luke 20:17 — quotes Psalm 118:22-23 ("The stone the builders rejected...")
- Matthew 22:44, Mark 12:36, Luke 20:42-43 — quotes Psalm 110:1 ("The Lord said to my Lord...")
- Matthew 23:39, Luke 13:35 — quotes Psalm 118:26 ("Blessed is he who comes...")
- Matthew 27:46, Mark 15:34 — quotes Psalm 22:1 ("My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?")
- Luke 23:46 — quotes Psalm 31:5 ("Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!")
- John 10:34 — quotes Psalm 82:6 ("I said, you are gods")
- John 13:18 — quotes Psalm 41:9 ("He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me")
- John 15:25 — quotes Psalm 35:19 / 69:4 ("They hated me without a cause")

Christ is the subject of the Psalms:

> Luke 24:44-47 — "Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms."

**So we pray the Psalms after Jesus, with Jesus, to Jesus, and through Jesus.**

### Composition and Arrangement

The 150 prayers have been intentionally ordered and arranged — not gathered randomly. This order is part of the divine inspiration.

The Book of Psalms is a **collection of collections**:

- **Psalms 1 & 2**: Introduction/Prologue
- **Psalms 42-49**: Sons of Korah collection
- **Psalms 73-83**: Asaph collection
- **Psalms 84-85, 87-88**: Sons of Korah
- **Psalms 93-100**: "Enthronement Psalms" ("The LORD reigns")
- **Psalms 113-118**: The Hallel (Egyptian Hallel, associated with Passover)
- **Psalms 120-134**: Songs of Ascent / Pilgrim Songs
- **Psalms 146-150**: Final Hallel (each opens/closes with "Hallelujah")

#### The Five Books

Organized into five books, echoing the Five Books of Torah:

- **Book 1**: Psalms 3-41
- **Book 2**: Psalms 42-72
- **Book 3**: Psalms 73-89
- **Book 4**: Psalms 90-106
- **Book 5**: Psalms 107-145

Each concludes with similar doxology: "May the Lord, the God of Israel, be blessed forever. Amen and Amen" (Ps. 41:13, 72:19, 89:52, 106:48)

### Theme #1: From Suffering to Praise

Psalms of Lament concentrate near the beginning; Psalms of Praise toward the end. Praying through the Psalms moves us through grief to praise. The final five "Hallelujah" Psalms punctuate this.

### Theme #2: The Need for a Joshua-type Successor to David

Psalms 1-2 as Prologue cause us to consider "the man" — blessed, delighting in God's teaching (a Joshua figure, cf. Joshua 1:8). This person is like a tree (tree of Life). Psalm 2 presents an anointed Son of David.

The Psalter invites us to look for the Joshua/Elisha figure to complement David — namely, **Jesus**.

**Psalter's Progression:**
- Books 1-2: Historical King David
- Book 3: Decline of David's throne (mirroring 2 Chronicles)
- Book 4: Exilic period, Moses prominent (Psalm 90), anticipating new Joshua
- Book 5: The greater David/Joshua arrives — fulfillment

> Psalm 72:20 — "This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse" signals that subsequent Davidic psalms transcend the historical figure.

### Theme #3: Return to the Presence of God

Psalm 1's "tree planted by streams of water" alludes to the tree of life in Eden. Humanity has been exiled from God's presence.

Key pairings: Sinai/Zion, Tabernacle/Temple, Rebuilt Temple/Jesus.

- **Books 1-2**: Anticipate building the temple
- **Book 3**: Possessing the temple guarantees nothing (Psalms 78-79, cf. Jeremiah 7)
- **Books 4-5**: Anticipate a new temple — Jesus himself

> Psalm 118:22-23 — "The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone"

The Psalter is designed as a **'virtual temple'** — connecting God's people to His presence through prayer. Through praying the Psalms we join with God's people to "Praise God in his sanctuary" (Psalm 150:1).

### Historical Use of the Psalms in Worship

**Early Church:**
- Tertullian (2nd century): worship revolved around Scripture and Psalms
- Jerome (4th century): Psalms sung everywhere

**Church Councils:**
- Laodicea (381 AD), Chalcedon (451 AD): discouraged anything but Psalms
- Braga (561 AD): prohibited outside poetic compositions
- Toledo (7th century): church leaders had to memorize the entire Psalter

**The Reformation:**
- Genevan Psalter became hugely popular
- French Huguenots known as "Psalm-singers"
- Scottish Covenanters drew comfort from Psalms in persecution
- After Reformation in England, metrical Psalms were almost the only praise songs until mid-18th century
- By 16th-17th centuries, Psalms sung by virtually every Christian tradition

### The Modern Shift

**Isaac Watts (18th century):**
- Identified disconnect between archaic Genevan tunes and contemporary culture
- Championed singability, clear language, accessible melodies
- Maintained theological depth with poetic flair
- "O God, Our Help in Ages Past," "When I Survey the Wondrous Cross"

**The Wesley Brothers (18th century):**
- Methodist revival movement
- Hymns as instruments of revival — emotional fervor
- Broader emotional palette in worship
- "Hark! The Herald Angels Sing," "O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing"

Together, Watts and the Wesleys ushered in a new era of hymn writing, prioritizing singability and emotional connection.

**20th Century — Contemporary Christian Music:**
- Hymns suffered similar disconnect as Genevan Psalms before them
- Bill & Gloria Gaither, Keith Green, Graham Kendrick, Jesus Movement
- CCM traded hymns for folk and rock melodies
- 1980s explosion: Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, megachurches
- Hillsong United became global phenomenon
- 2000s: diversification, "modern hymn" movement emerged
- Debate over lyrical depth continues

**Today:** Churches navigate a spectrum — hymns, CCM, blended — but **the Psalms, the almost exclusive foundation of worship for centuries, largely remain on the sidelines.**

### The Need for a New Psalter

- People are suffering and have few resources. The Psalms were that resource.
- The Psalms offer timeless resources for navigating human emotions
- They validate emotional experience while urging management through reflection, prayer, and Scripture
- The church must teach people how to pray the Psalms both corporately and individually
- Music is necessary and aids in memorization
- We ought not select Psalms at our own discretion — proceed through them following divine arrangement
