### Core Why
The South Florida Psalter exists to help the church recover the Psalms as the lived prayer and songbook of God's people. Few Christians sing the Psalms regularly — this project closes that gap by making them singable, memorable, and emotionally honest for modern worshipers.

Conviction: God gave us the Psalms so we would have words to pray and songs to sing in every season of life — joy, fear, doubt, repentance, hope, and praise — and the church is impoverished when those words are replaced rather than embodied.

### Key Principles
1. **Scripture First** — The biblical text governs the song. Music serves the text. Word-for-word reproduction of the Psalm (NIV 2011).
2. **Every Psalm Has Its Own Emotional World** — Each Psalm is a complete emotional and theological unit. Laments sound like lament; praise sounds like praise. Style matches emotional truth.
3. **Modern Styles for Modern Ears** — Contemporary musical styles: modern worship, pop, cinematic, musical theater. The Psalms were written for their time; these settings do the same today.
4. **Singability and Memorability** — Crafted to be learned, remembered, and sung repeatedly by individuals, families, and congregations. Strong hooks, repetition, clear structure.
5. **Whole-Life Worship** — Not only triumphant and polished, but raw, honest, and formative. Doubt, complaint, confession, and waiting on God are given voice.
6. **Integration with Prayer and PROS** — Designed to function alongside Public Reading of Scripture services and Pray150. Singing, listening, and praying Scripture reinforce each other.

## Production
- Scott is visionary, primary composer, arranger, and theological editor
- Uses AI music tools (primarily Suno) with very detailed prompts (style, emotional arc, structure, theology)
- Heavy iteration: regenerating, revising lyrics, re-prompting, curating outputs
- No outside studio or hired musicians yet (future phase)
- Functions as composer/producer using AI as instrument

## Current State (as of 2026-02-07)
- All 150 Psalms at least drafted musically (first draft minimum)
- Significant number published, in active worship use, integrated into Pray150
- Multitracks created for live worship teams + chord sheets in corresponding keys (labor intensive)
- Living canon with versioning — not "finished and locked"
- Fragmented, founder-driven management — all bottlenecks through Scott

## Active Workstreams
- New content creation (ongoing composition, improving the Psalter)
- Curation and revision (what stays, what gets redone)
- Integration with Pray150 (music, journaling prompts, devotional flow)
- Worship usage (PROS services, congregational singing)
- Light promotion (YouTube, pastors, informal networks)

## What's Missing
- No polished distribution engine
- No systematic church adoption pipeline
- No managed product roadmap
- No version control system (final vs provisional)
- No metadata/tagging/organization system
- No dedicated website for South Florida Psalter
- No social media strategy
- No research arm
- No article/content writing for promotion
- No podcast
- No formal team — solo project with informal collaborators

## The Vision
- Reintroduce the Psalms to the world → modern church reformation
- Most Christians have never sung the Psalms — missing its power
- Hundreds of thousands of churches adopting Psalm singing
- Get Psalm songs to hit CCLI Top 100, one at a time

## What the South Florida Psalter Website Needs
- Vision and philosophy
- Sheet music, chord sheets, multitracks access
- Introductions to each Psalm
- Explanation videos
- South Florida Psalter podcast
- Research arm (world's leading expert on Psalms in Christian worship)
- Articles promoting SFP and Pray150

## Relationship
- Pray150 = the devotional/prayer engine
- South Florida Psalter = the creative/musical engine
- Both serve the same vision: bringing people back into the Psalms
- Both connect to PROS (Public Reading of Scripture) services
