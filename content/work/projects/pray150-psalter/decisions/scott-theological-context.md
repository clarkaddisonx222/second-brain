# Scott's Theological Context & SFP Rationale

## Denominational Identity

**Tradition:** Reformed
**Denomination:** Christian Reformed Church in North America (CRCNA)
**Key Connection:** Calvin College (now University) — the denominational college of the CRCNA

This context is essential for understanding the South Florida Psalter project and its relationship to existing Psalm-singing traditions.

## Position on the Genevan Psalter

### Honoring the History

Scott acknowledges and respects the historical significance of the **Genevan Psalter** (1562), the historic Psalm-singing tradition of the Reformed churches. This tradition represents centuries of faithful worship and theological commitment to singing God's Word.

### The Need to Move Forward

**Core Belief:** The church needs a **new Psalter** for the modern context.

**Rationale:**
- Genevan Psalms, while historically significant, do not fit modern worship contexts
- Musical styles, instrumentation, and congregational participation have evolved
- Contemporary churches need accessible, singable Psalm settings that connect with today's worshipers
- The Genevan tunes, while beautiful, can feel inaccessible to modern congregations

## Why South Florida Psalter Exists

### The Gap in the Market

**Observation:** No one else is working on a comprehensive modern Psalter in the way Scott has been approaching it.

**What Makes SFP Different:**
1. **Complete coverage** — All 150 Psalms (not just favorites)
2. **Word-for-word** — Faithful to NIV 2011 text
3. **Original compositions** — Fresh music, not repurposed old tunes
4. **Modern production** — Quality comparable to contemporary worship music
5. **Full multimedia** — Videos, chord sheets, multitracks for churches
6. **CCLI strategy** — Designed for broad church adoption

### The Vision

Reintroducing the Psalms to the world through modern worship — leading a reformation in how churches sing Scripture.

**Goal:** Get Psalm songs into CCLI Top 100, seeing hundreds of thousands of churches adopt Psalm singing as a regular part of worship.

## Relationship to Calvin Institute of Christian Worship (CICW)

**Context:** The CICW at Calvin University represents the institutional heart of Reformed worship scholarship. Scott's connection to this tradition (through CRCNA membership and Calvin's denominational status) gives him both:

- **Credibility** within the Reformed tradition
- **Unique perspective** as a practitioner pushing boundaries

**Strategic Note:** While honoring the Genevan heritage that CICW represents and studies, SFP is positioned as the *next generation* — not a rejection of the past, but an evolution for the present.

## Key Distinctions

| Aspect | Genevan Tradition | South Florida Psalter |
|--------|-------------------|----------------------|
| **Music style** | 16th-century modal tunes | Contemporary worship styles |
| **Instrumentation** | Organ/acapella | Full band, modern production |
| **Accessibility** | Requires musical training | Designed for congregational singing |
| **Text** | Metrical paraphrases (often old translations) | Word-for-word NIV 2011 |
| **Distribution** | Denominational hymnals | YouTube, streaming, CCLI |
| **Scope** | Select Psalms (common ones) | All 150 Psalms |

## Implications for Research & Communication

**For Elise and the Research Team:**
- When writing about Psalm-singing history, acknowledge Genevan tradition as the foundation
- Clearly position SFP as building *upon* that foundation, not replacing it
- Emphasize the "unreached" aspect — modern churches that have no connection to Genevan tradition
- Frame the project as filling a gap, not competing with heritage

**For Church Adoption Strategy:**
- CRCNA churches may be natural early adopters (denominational connection)
- Other Reformed traditions (PCA, OPC, EPC) represent expansion opportunities
- Mainline denominations (many with Reformed roots) could be receptive
- Contemporary/non-denominational churches are the primary target (the "unreached" of Psalm singing)

**For Marketing/Communication:**
- "Honoring the past, singing for today"
- "The Psalms — reimagined for modern worship"
- Position as complement to, not replacement of, traditional Psalm singing

## Decision Log

**Date:** February 8, 2026
**Context:** Response to Elise's CICW research review
**Key Clarifications:**
1. CRCNA minister identity established
2. Genevan Psalter respected but not the path forward
3. SFP fills unique gap in modern worship landscape
4. Project targets churches with no Psalm-singing tradition

**Next Steps:**
- Update team briefings with this context
- Ensure all communications honor Reformed heritage while promoting innovation
- Use denominational connection strategically with CRCNA and related traditions
