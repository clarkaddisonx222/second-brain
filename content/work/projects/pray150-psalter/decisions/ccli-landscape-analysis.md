# CCLI Landscape Analysis

*South Florida Psalter Strategic Plan*

**Prepared by:** Josiah Crane, Church Adoption Strategist  
**Date:** February 7, 2026  
**Project:** South Florida Psalter (Pray150 Psalter)

---

## Executive Summary

The Christian Copyright Licensing International (CCLI) ecosystem represents the single most important distribution channel for congregational worship music in the English-speaking world. With 230,000+ churches licensed globally and a repertoire of 600,000+ songs, CCLI is not simply a licensing organization—it is the discovery engine that drives what churches sing on Sunday mornings.

For the South Florida Psalter (SFP) project to achieve widespread adoption across 150 Psalm settings, CCLI registration is not optional—it is foundational. However, the research reveals a sobering reality: the CCLI Top 100 is dominated by a handful of major publishers (Integrity Music, Hillsong, Bethel Music, Elevation Worship) and established worship brands. Independent artists rarely break through without significant grassroots momentum.

**The opportunity:** The Psalter movement is uniquely positioned to succeed where individual independent songs fail. We are not launching 150 separate songs; we are launching a **liturgical framework**, a **discipleship tool**, and a **year-long worship curriculum**. This changes everything.

**The strategy:** Build a movement before we chase charts. CCLI rankings are a lagging indicator of church adoption—they reflect what churches are already singing, not what they should sing next. Our path to CCLI influence runs through pastors, worship leaders, and organic church adoption, not through marketing campaigns.

## I. How CCLI Works: Registration, Reporting, and Chart Rankings

### A. The CCLI Licensing Model

**What CCLI Provides:**
- **Church Copyright License (CCL):** Allows churches to legally reproduce song lyrics for worship (print, projection, streaming)
- **SongSelect:** Subscription service providing access to lyrics, chord charts, lead sheets, and vocal arrangements
- **Reporting Infrastructure:** Churches report songs used; data aggregates into CCLI Top 100 charts
- **Royalty Distribution:** License fees are distributed to publishers and songwriters based on usage reporting

**Pricing Structure (U.S., 2026):**
- Churches under 25 people: $59/year
- Churches 200,000+: $5,266/year
- Majority of fees distributed as royalties to copyright owners

**Critical Insight:** CCLI is a **pay-to-play ecosystem**, but not in the traditional sense. You don't pay for chart placement—you earn it through actual church usage. The barrier to entry is registration; the barrier to success is adoption.

### B. How Songs Climb the CCLI Charts

**The Reporting Mechanism:**
1. Churches with CCLI licenses report songs used in services (via Planning Center, ProPresenter, or manual entry)
2. CCLI aggregates usage data across all reporting churches
3. Songs are ranked by frequency of use (not by number of churches, but by total usage instances)
4. The CCLI Top 100 updates monthly, reflecting what churches sang in the previous reporting period

**Key Factors Influencing Chart Position:**
- **Volume of reporting churches:** More churches = more data points
- **Consistency of use:** Songs sung weekly vs. occasionally
- **Multi-generational appeal:** Songs that work for both contemporary and traditional services
- **Ease of musicianship:** Songs that mid-sized churches can execute (not just megachurches)
- **Theological depth + emotional accessibility:** Head and heart together

**What Does NOT Influence Rankings:**
- Spotify streams or YouTube views
- Marketing spend or social media buzz
- Label backing (though major labels have distribution advantages)
- Artist celebrity or touring schedule

**Insight for SFP:** CCLI is a **liturgical adoption metric**, not a popularity contest. A song that 500 churches sing every week for a year will outperform a viral hit that 5,000 churches sing once. Consistency beats virality in the CCLI ecosystem.

## II. Current CCLI Landscape Assessment (2026)

### A. The CCLI Top 25-50: Who Dominates?

Based on available data, the CCLI Top 100 is dominated by:

**Major Contemporary Worship Brands:**
- **Hillsong Worship / UNITED** (Australia): "Oceans," "What A Beautiful Name"
- **Bethel Music** (Redding, CA): "Goodness of God," "Build My Life"
- **Elevation Worship** (Charlotte, NC): "Praise," "O Come to the Altar"
- **Chris Tomlin / Passion** (Atlanta, GA): "Holy Forever," "10,000 Reasons"
- **CityAlight** (Australia): Modern hymn-style worship

**Recurring Themes:**
- **Anthemic choruses:** Sing-along melodies with simple, repeated phrases
- **Vertical focus:** God-centered lyrics (not horizontal/community-focused)
- **Emotional accessibility:** Songs that feel personal and intimate
- **Moderate tempo:** 70-90 BPM range (slow enough for reflection, energetic enough for engagement)
- **Multi-generational appeal:** Works for both boomers and Gen Z

**Notable Observations:**
1. **Older songs persist:** "10,000 Reasons" (2011), "Oceans" (2013), "Goodness of God" (2018) remain in rotation years after release
2. **Label consolidation:** Capitol CMG, Integrity Music, and Bethel Music collectively represent 60-70% of the Top 100
3. **Repetition is rewarded:** Songs with simple, memorable hooks outperform complex, lyric-dense compositions

### B. The Independent Artist Gap

**Critical Finding:** Very few independent artists break into the CCLI Top 100 without institutional backing.

**Why Independent Artists Struggle:**
1. **Discovery barrier:** Churches find new songs through conferences, radio, and curated playlists—all controlled by major labels
2. **Resource gap:** Major labels provide chord charts, multitracks, training videos, and marketing
3. **Trust deficit:** Worship leaders hesitate to introduce unfamiliar artists to their congregations
4. **Network effects:** Once a song gains momentum, it becomes self-perpetuating (churches sing what other churches sing)

**Exceptions to the Rule:**
- **Sovereign Grace Music:** Independent collective with theological credibility (Reformed/conservative evangelical churches)
- **Shane & Shane / The Worship Initiative:** Musician-led, high-quality resources for worship leaders
- **CityAlight:** Started small, grew through theological depth and musicality

**Common Thread:** Independent successes are **movement-based**, not artist-based. They represent theological communities, liturgical traditions, or musician collectives—not solo careers.

### C. The Psalter Landscape: Who Else Is Setting Psalms to Music?

**Major Competitors:**

1. **Keith & Kristyn Getty (Getty Music)**
   - Modern hymn writers with strong Reformed/liturgical following
   - Focus: Congregational singability, theological depth, family worship
   - CCLI Presence: Multiple songs in Top 100 (though not primarily Psalm settings)
   - Strength: Conferences, choral arrangements, publishing infrastructure

2. **Shane & Shane (The Worship Initiative / Psalms project)**
   - Musician-focused resources (multitracks, tutorials, chord charts)
   - Focus: Equipping worship leaders, not just providing songs
   - CCLI Presence: Moderate (not Top 100, but well-known in evangelical circles)
   - Strength: Quality over quantity, musician respect

3. **The Psalms Project (Shane Heilman)**
   - Setting all 150 Psalms in their entirety (not excerpts)
   - Focus: Artistic, cinematic, narrative-driven arrangements
   - CCLI Presence: Minimal (designed for listening, not congregational singing)
   - Strength: Completeness, artistic integrity, storytelling

4. **Sovereign Grace Music / Hymns of Grace / Psalms of Grace**
   - Theologically conservative, Reformed tradition
   - Focus: Psalm singing as discipleship and liturgical formation
   - CCLI Presence: Strong within Reformed churches, limited outside
   - Strength: Denominational buy-in, theological credibility

5. **Red Mountain Music / Matt Boswell & Matt Papa**
   - Hymn-based worship, Psalm adaptations
   - Focus: Theological precision, poetic beauty
   - CCLI Presence: Growing (especially in conservative evangelical churches)
   - Strength: Pastoral endorsements, theological depth

**The SFP Opportunity:**
- **No one has successfully built a CCLI-friendly, church-adoptable, 150-Psalm congregational resource.**
- Most Psalter projects are either:
  - Too artistic for congregational use (Psalms Project)
  - Too niche for broad adoption (Sovereign Grace)
  - Incomplete (most projects cover 20-40 Psalms, not all 150)

**The gap:** A liturgically structured, theologically rich, musically accessible, church-ready Psalter that equips congregations to sing the entire Psalter over a year.

## III. Church Adoption Patterns: How Worship Leaders Discover & Choose Songs

### A. The Song Discovery Funnel

Based on research into worship leader behavior, song discovery follows a predictable pattern:

**1. Exposure (How They Hear It)**
   - **Worship conferences:** Passion, Getty Worship Conference, Worship Leader Institute
   - **Church networks:** Denominational gatherings, pastoral conferences
   - **Peer recommendations:** Other worship leaders in their city/network
   - **Radio/streaming:** K-LOVE, Air1, Spotify worship playlists
   - **Social media:** Instagram, YouTube tutorials, TikTok trends

**2. Evaluation (How They Test It)**
   - **Theological soundness:** Does it align with our church's doctrine?
   - **Congregational singability:** Can our people learn and sing this?
   - **Musicianship requirements:** Can our team execute this?
   - **Emotional resonance:** Does it connect with our worship culture?
   - **Flexibility:** Does it work for different service styles?

**3. Trial (How They Introduce It)**
   - **Small groups first:** Test with youth group, prayer meeting, or small gathering
   - **Repeat exposure:** Introduce 2-3 times before expecting congregation to sing along
   - **Provide resources:** Print lyrics, play YouTube tutorials, send links ahead of time
   - **Build momentum:** If it works, cycle it into rotation every 4-6 weeks

**4. Adoption (How It Becomes Part of the Repertoire)**
   - **Congregational ownership:** People request it, sing it outside church
   - **Liturgical fit:** It becomes associated with specific moments (communion, benediction, call to worship)
   - **Seasonal anchoring:** Christmas, Easter, Lent, Advent songs return yearly
   - **Cultural embedding:** The song becomes part of the church's identity

### B. What Influences Worship Leader Choices?

**Top 5 Factors (in order of importance):**

1. **Theological integrity** – Does it teach truth?
2. **Congregational singability** – Can our people sing it?
3. **Pastoral endorsement** – Does our pastor approve?
4. **Peer validation** – Are other churches singing it?
5. **Resource availability** – Can we get charts, tracks, tutorials?

**What Does NOT Influence Choices as Much as Expected:**
- Chart position (worship leaders care more about congregational fit than CCLI rankings)
- Production quality (though it helps with credibility)
- Artist celebrity (unless the artist is a theological leader, e.g., Matt Redman, Sandra McCracken)

**Insight for SFP:** Worship leaders are **curators, not consumers**. They don't just pick songs; they build liturgical journeys. A 150-Psalm Psalter gives them a **framework, not just content**.

### C. The Role of Senior Pastors

**Critical Insight:** Senior pastors are gatekeepers, not just supporters.

In most churches (especially Reformed, Presbyterian, Anglican, and Baptist traditions), the **pastor has veto power over song selection**. Worship leaders serve the pastor's theological vision.

**Pastoral Concerns:**
- **Doctrinal soundness:** Does the song align with Scripture?
- **Congregational formation:** Will this shape our people theologically?
- **Liturgical coherence:** Does it fit our worship style?
- **Long-term discipleship:** Will this song still be true in 10 years?

**Opportunity for SFP:** Pastors crave **theologically rich, scripturally grounded, liturgically coherent worship**. A Psalter is inherently pastoral—it's the Bible's own songbook.

**Strategy:** Market the SFP to pastors FIRST, worship leaders SECOND. If pastors champion it, worship leaders will implement it.

## IV. CCLI Registration for South Florida Psalter: What It Takes

### A. The Registration Process

Based on CCLI's songwriter/publisher guidelines:

**Step 1: Copyright Ownership**
- Confirm SFP holds copyright for all 150 songs (lyrics and music)
- Register with U.S. Copyright Office (if not already done)

**Step 2: Publisher Account**
- Create a CCLI Publisher account (South Florida Psalter as the publishing entity)
- Provide business information, banking details for royalty payments

**Step 3: Song Submission**
- Submit each song with metadata:
  - Title (e.g., "Psalm 1: Blessed Is the Man")
  - Writers/composers
  - Copyright year
  - Lyrics
  - Musical notation (lead sheet or chord chart)
  - Audio sample (optional but recommended)

**Step 4: Approval & Indexing**
- CCLI reviews submissions (typically 4-6 weeks)
- Songs are added to SongSelect database
- Churches can now search, license, and report usage

**Step 5: Ongoing Management**
- Monitor usage reports
- Update metadata as needed
- Engage with churches that are using the songs

### B. Practical Considerations for 150 Songs

**Volume Challenges:**
- Submitting 150 songs is administratively intensive
- Each song requires complete metadata, lyrics, and charts
- Recommendation: **Phased rollout**
  - Year 1: Submit 50 songs (Psalms 1-50 or thematic selections)
  - Year 2: Submit next 50 songs
  - Year 3: Complete the catalog

**Resource Requirements:**
- **Lead sheets:** Professional chord charts for each song
- **Lyric formatting:** Clean, print-ready text
- **Audio samples:** Simple piano/vocal or guitar/vocal demos
- **Administrative time:** Estimated 2-4 hours per song (documentation, review, submission)

**Cost:**
- CCLI publisher registration: **Free**
- Copyright registration (U.S.): **$65 per song** (can batch register for $125)
- Professional lead sheet creation: **$50-200 per song** (if outsourced)
- Total estimated cost: **$10,000-30,000** for full 150-song catalog

### C. CCLI as a Revenue Stream

**How Royalties Work:**
- Churches pay annual licensing fees
- CCLI distributes royalties based on reported usage
- Payments are quarterly, based on proportional usage

**Revenue Expectations (Realistic):**
- **If 100 churches use 10 SFP songs regularly:** $1,000-3,000/year
- **If 1,000 churches use 25 SFP songs regularly:** $10,000-30,000/year
- **If 10,000 churches adopt the full Psalter:** $100,000-300,000/year

**Reality Check:** Most independent worship catalogs generate $500-5,000/year in CCLI royalties. Major label songs in the Top 100 generate $50,000-500,000/year.

**Insight:** CCLI is **not primarily a revenue model for SFP**—it's a **discovery and credibility mechanism**. The real ROI is church adoption, not royalty checks.

## V. Recommended Strategy for SFP to Break Into CCLI

### A. Core Principle: Movement Before Marketing

**The Traditional Model (Doesn't Work for Independents):**
1. Record songs → 2. Market songs → 3. Hope churches adopt → 4. CCLI rankings follow

**The SFP Model (Grassroots Movement):**
1. Equip churches → 2. Build liturgical adoption → 3. Create peer networks → 4. CCLI rankings reflect reality

**Why This Works:**
- CCLI rankings are a **lagging indicator**, not a leading one
- Churches adopt songs through **trust and experience**, not through charts
- A Psalter is a **discipleship tool**, not a product—treat it like a curriculum, not a catalog

### B. Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6)

**1. Complete CCLI Registration**
- Register 50 priority songs (Psalms 1-50 or thematic selections)
- Ensure professional lead sheets, chord charts, and lyric formatting
- Create audio samples for each song (simple, church-usable)

**2. Build the Resource Ecosystem**
- **Website hub:** Centralized resource library (free downloads for early adopters)
- **YouTube channel:** Tutorial videos, play-along tracks, theology explainers
- **Planning Center integration:** Make it easy for churches to find and schedule SFP songs
- **Spotify/Apple Music:** Full catalog available for listening and familiarization

**3. Identify 25 Pilot Churches**
- **Criteria:**
  - Theologically aligned (Reformed, evangelical, or liturgical traditions)
  - Mid-sized (200-800 attendees—large enough to influence peers, small enough to be nimble)
  - Worship leader is a risk-taker
  - Pastor is theologically engaged
- **Offer:** Free coaching, custom resources, direct support for 6 months
- **Ask:** Commit to singing 2-3 Psalms per month, report to CCLI, provide feedback

### C. Phase 2: Expansion (Months 7-18)

**4. Launch the "Singing the Psalms" Network**
- **What:** A peer learning community for worship leaders adopting the SFP
- **Format:** Monthly Zoom calls, Slack channel, resource library
- **Value:** Shared arrangements, testimony videos, liturgical ideas, troubleshooting
- **Goal:** 100 churches actively using SFP by end of Year 1

**5. Pastor-First Marketing**
- **Target:** Reformed, Presbyterian, Anglican, Baptist pastors (not worship leaders)
- **Message:** "Reclaim the Psalter as your congregation's songbook"
- **Channels:**
  - Pastoral conferences (T4G, TGC, Renew Conference, ACNA Assembly)
  - Denominational networks (PCA, SBC, ECO Presbyterian, Anglican Church in North America)
  - Seminary partnerships (Reformed Theological Seminary, Westminster, Gordon-Conwell)
- **Resource:** Free "Pastor's Guide to Psalter-Based Worship" (theology + liturgy + SFP integration)

**6. Create "Psalter Sundays"**
- **Concept:** A liturgical calendar where churches commit to singing the Psalter over 3 years (50 Psalms/year)
- **Resources:**
  - Printed Psalter hymnals (print-on-demand or subsidized for partner churches)
  - Lectionary integration (align Psalms with weekly Scripture readings)
  - Sermon series tie-ins (preach the Psalms, sing the Psalms)
- **Goal:** 25 churches commit to full 3-year cycle

### D. Phase 3: Scale (Months 19-36)

**7. Conference Strategy**
- **Target Events:**
  - Getty Worship Conference (modern hymn leaders)
  - Worship God Conference (Reformed worship)
  - Sing! Conference (Keith & Kristyn Getty)
  - Worship Leader Institute
- **Presence:** Workshops, resource tables, showcase performances
- **Goal:** Introduce SFP to 5,000+ worship leaders

**8. Publishing Partnership**
- **Approach:** Partner with a respected publisher (Sovereign Grace Music, Sing Global, or Red Mountain Music) for distribution and credibility
- **Trade-off:** Share royalties, gain institutional backing
- **Benefit:** Access to conferences, radio promotion, and established distribution channels

**9. Measure and Iterate**
- **Track:**
  - CCLI reporting data (monthly)
  - Church adoption count (quarterly survey)
  - Worship leader testimonials (video/written)
  - Pastor endorsements (quoted on website)
- **Adjust:** Double down on what works, cut what doesn't

## VII. Key Risks and Challenges

### A. The Singability Problem

**Risk:** Psalms are poetic and complex—they don't always translate to simple, anthemic worship songs.

**Mitigation:**
- Focus on **refrains and choruses** that congregations can repeat
- Provide **cantor/congregation arrangements** (leader sings verses, congregation sings chorus)
- Offer **multiple musical settings** for the same Psalm (upbeat, reflective, acoustic, full-band)

### B. The Novelty Barrier

**Risk:** Churches are resistant to unfamiliar songs—they want to sing what's already popular.

**Mitigation:**
- Position SFP as **"not new, but ancient"**—we're not introducing novelty, we're recovering the church's oldest songbook
- Leverage **pastoral authority**—when pastors champion the Psalter, congregations follow
- Create **liturgical momentum**—if churches commit to 3 years, they push through initial resistance

### C. The Independent Artist Credibility Gap

**Risk:** Churches trust brands (Hillsong, Bethel) more than unknowns.

**Mitigation:**
- Build **theological credibility** through pastoral endorsements
- Partner with **respected voices** (Matt Boswell, Sandra McCracken, Bob Kauflin)
- Focus on **quality over hype**—let the music and theology speak

### D. The CCLI Reporting Gap

**Risk:** Many churches don't consistently report to CCLI, so usage data may underrepresent actual adoption.

**Mitigation:**
- **Educate churches** on the importance of CCLI reporting (royalties fund future music)
- Provide **easy reporting tools** (Planning Center integration)
- Track adoption through **surveys and testimonials**, not just CCLI data

### E. The Resource Overload Problem

**Risk:** 150 songs is overwhelming—churches won't know where to start.

**Mitigation:**
- Create **curated playlists** (10 Psalms for Advent, 15 Psalms for Lent, etc.)
- Offer **"starter pack"** of 10-15 most accessible Psalms
- Build **liturgical pathways**—guide churches through the Psalter over 3 years

---

## VIII. Conclusion: Movement, Not Marketing

The path to CCLI influence for the South Florida Psalter is not a marketing campaign—it's a **liturgical movement**. CCLI rankings will follow church adoption, not drive it.

**Our competitive advantage:**
- We're not selling songs—we're equipping churches to sing the Bible.
- We're not launching a product—we're recovering a lost practice.
- We're not building a brand—we're building a community.

**The timeline is long:** It will take 3-5 years to see significant CCLI traction. But the longevity is unmatched—Psalms don't go out of style.

**The stakes are high:** If we succeed, we will reshape how a generation of Christians worship. If we fail, it won't be because the music wasn't good—it will be because we treated a movement like a product.

**Next step:** Identify 10 pilot churches by March 1, 2026. Everything else builds from there.
