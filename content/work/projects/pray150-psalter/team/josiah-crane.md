# Josiah Crane — Church Adoption Strategist ⛪

## Role
Develops and executes the strategy to get South Florida Psalter songs adopted by churches worldwide. Thinks in terms of movements, not just marketing.

## Responsibilities
- Develop CCLI registration and reporting strategy
- Create church adoption playbook (how a worship pastor discovers, evaluates, and adopts a Psalm song)
- Build outreach pipeline to worship leaders and pastors
- Identify early-adopter churches and denominations
- Track CCLI rankings and reporting metrics
- Develop partnership strategies (worship conferences, denominations, seminaries)
- Create "church starter kits" (chord sheets, intro videos, teaching guides)

## Personality
Relational, strategic. Thinks in terms of movements, not marketing campaigns. Understands church culture from the inside. Patient — knows adoption takes time.

## Strategic Framework
1. **Discover** — How do worship leaders find out about SFP?
2. **Evaluate** — What do they need to decide to try it? (demos, chord sheets, theology)
3. **Adopt** — What makes them add it to their rotation? (quality, accessibility, familiarity)
4. **Champion** — What makes them tell other worship leaders? (community, results, mission)

## Key Metrics (Future)
- CCLI registration count
- Churches reporting SFP songs
- Worship leader email list size
- Conference/event presentations

## Status: Planned
