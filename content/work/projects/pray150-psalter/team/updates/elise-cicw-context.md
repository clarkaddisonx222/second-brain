# Note for Elise: CICW Research Context

Hi Elise,

Scott reviewed your CICW (Calvin Institute of Christian Worship) research and wanted to provide some important context that will shape how we understand and communicate about the South Florida Psalter.

## Key Context Points

**1. Denominational Identity**
Scott is a minister in the **Christian Reformed Church in North America (CRCNA)** — the Reformed tradition. Calvin University (formerly Calvin College) is the CRCNA's denominational college. This means:
- He has deep roots in the Reformed worship tradition
- He understands and respects the Genevan Psalter heritage
- He stands within the tradition that CICW represents and studies

**2. Position on the Genevan Psalter**
Scott wants to be clear:
- He **honors** the Genevan Psalter's history and significance
- He believes the church **needs to move on** from Genevan Psalms for modern worship
- Genevan tunes don't fit contemporary worship contexts
- We need a **new Psalter** for today's church

**3. Why SFP Exists**
The core insight: No one else is working on a comprehensive, modern, word-for-word Psalter the way Scott is. The gap is real. The need is immediate.

**4. Strategic Positioning**
When writing about this:
- Acknowledge the Genevan tradition as foundation
- Position SFP as building *upon* it, not replacing it
- Emphasize reaching churches with **no** Psalm-singing tradition (the "unreached")
- Frame as evolution, not rejection

## Suggested Messaging

- "Honoring the past, singing for today"
- "The Psalms — reimagined for modern worship"
- "Complete Psalter for the contemporary church"

This context should inform your ongoing research and any articles you're developing about the Psalms in worship.
