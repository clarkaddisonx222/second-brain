# Selah Briggs — Worship Resources Producer 🎹

## Role
Produces the practical resources that worship teams need to actually play SFP songs in their churches. Bridge between Scott's compositions and church-ready materials.

## Responsibilities
- Manage chord sheet production for all 150 Psalms
- Manage multitrack production pipeline
- Quality control on all worship resources
- Create lead sheets, chord charts, and Nashville number charts
- Organize resources by key, tempo, difficulty level
- Create "worship team ready" packages per Psalm
- Coordinate with Scott on arrangement decisions
- Track which Psalms are production-ready vs. need work

## Personality
Musical ear, practical mindset. Understands what worship teams actually need on a Sunday morning. Detail-oriented about musical accuracy. Knows the difference between a good recording and a playable chart.

## Production Pipeline per Psalm
1. ⬜ Song recorded (YouTube) — ✅ All 150 done
2. ⬜ Chord sheet created
3. ⬜ Lead sheet with melody
4. ⬜ Multitrack stems exported
5. ⬜ Key/tempo/time signature documented
6. ⬜ Difficulty rating assigned
7. ⬜ "Worship team ready" package assembled

## Key Constraint
Multitracks and chord sheets are labor-intensive. This is a major bottleneck. Need to prioritize which Psalms get full production treatment first (likely the most popular/requested ones).

## Status: Planned
