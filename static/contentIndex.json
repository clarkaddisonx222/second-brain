They implemented cost controls for AI models, added family information, created quick-capture workflows, and established automated daily updates. This conversation also initiated the creation of a conversation archive feature.\nThread Overview\nThread 1: Model Cost Management\nStarted: 10:49 AM\nScott reported maxing out AI model credits overnight. Clark reconfigured the system:\n\nSet Kimi K2.5 as primary default\nEstablished fallback chain: Kimi → Gemini Flash → Nexos\nCreated cost thresholds: 1/day switch trigger, 2/day emergency stop\nSet up 4-hourly cost monitoring alerts\nConfigured morning/evening dashboard updates\n\nKey Decisions:\n\nDefault to Kimi K2.5 for quality\nAutomatic tier-switching based on spend\nPause all work if Nexos exceeds $2/day\n\n\nThread 2: South Florida Psalter Website\nStarted: 12:11 PM\nScott asked for his South Florida Psalter URL. Clark discovered the site was built but not deployed. They discussed deployment options but parked this for later completion.\n\nThread 3: Building the Second Brain\nStarted: 1:21 PM\nScott requested a Second Brain system for personal and work knowledge management.

This document represents the implementation — organizing all their conversations into searchable, threaded records with summaries and full transcripts.\n\nFull Transcript\nOpening (10:49 AM)\nScott: It appears that we maxed out credits in our available models last night. I just added credits, but I want this openclaw bot to run as efficiently as possible. Could you set up some parameters to make sure that all agents and subagents try to do everything for free. Also we missed our 6am report as a result\nClark: I’ll check the current configuration and set up an efficient model strategy…\n[Clark checks session status and gateway config]\nClark updated the model configuration:\n\nPrimary: Kimi K2.5 (OpenRouter)\nFallbacks: Nexos Google Gemini 3 Flash Preview → Nexos GPT 4.1 → Nexos Claude Sonnet 4.5\nRestarted gateway to apply changes\nSpawned missed 6 AM dashboard update\n\nScott: [Later] I want to rearrange models: I want Kimi K 2.5 to be the default. But if it goes over 1 per day then I want you to switch to Gemini Flash, and if we use it too much to switch to Nexos. But if Nexos uses more than 2/day then I would like you to pause all work and query me about what to do.\nClark: Config updated and gateway is restarting…\nClark set up:\n\nKimi K2.5 as primary\n4-hourly cost monitoring cron job\nAlert thresholds at 0.80, 1.00, 1.80, and 2.00\nEmergency stop protocol\n\nSouth Florida Psalter (12:11 PM)\nScott: What is my South Florida psalter url\nClark: [Searches memory] Let me check the project files…\n[Discovers site not deployed]\nClark: The South Florida Psalter website is built and ready but not yet deployed…\nScott: [1h later] Go for it\n[Clark attempts deployment, encounters GitHub Pages issues, creates alternative scott-brain repo]\nSecond Brain Design (1:21 PM)\nScott: Today I want us to build a second brain. I want this second brain to keep track of all important information and be an easily accessible site for me…\nClark: Quartz — it’s specifically built for this. Beautiful, graph-connected, searchable…\n[Detailed discussion of structure, input methods, deployment]\nScott: Go for it\n[Clark spawns subagent to build Second Brain, encounters issues, completes manually]\nClark: It’s live! clarkaddisonx222.github.io/scott-brain/\nScott: [Requests all 5 suggestions be completed]\n[Clark implements all 5: test entry, auto-population, sermon import, quick-capture, daily dashboard]\nFirst Entry (2:18 PM)\nScott: I like all 5 suggestions. For my first entry, remember my family’s birthdays…\n[Clark saves birthdays, deploys to site]\nClark: Done! clarkaddisonx222.github.io/scott-brain/personal/people/family-birthdays\nMark Summary (4:02 PM)\nScott: Give me a quick summary of Mark 5-8, in bullet points\n[Clark provides summary]\nConversation Archive Request (4:05 PM)\nScott: I was just thinking that there should be a place in our second brain that houses all the conversations we have…\nClark: Great idea.

With 230,000+ churches licensed globally and a repertoire of 600,000+ songs, CCLI is not simply a licensing organization—it is the discovery engine that drives what churches sing on Sunday mornings.\nFor the South Florida Psalter (SFP) project to achieve widespread adoption across 150 Psalm settings, CCLI registration is not optional—it is foundational. However, the research reveals a sobering reality: the CCLI Top 100 is dominated by a handful of major publishers (Integrity Music, Hillsong, Bethel Music, Elevation Worship) and established worship brands. Independent artists rarely break through without significant grassroots momentum.\nThe opportunity: The Psalter movement is uniquely positioned to succeed where individual independent songs fail. We are not launching 150 separate songs; we are launching a liturgical framework, a discipleship tool, and a year-long worship curriculum. This changes everything.\nThe strategy: Build a movement before we chase charts. CCLI rankings are a lagging indicator of church adoption—they reflect what churches are already singing, not what they should sing next. Our path to CCLI influence runs through pastors, worship leaders, and organic church adoption, not through marketing campaigns.\n\nI. How CCLI Works: Registration, Reporting, and Chart Rankings\nA. The CCLI Licensing Model\nWhat CCLI Provides:\n\nChurch Copyright License (CCL): Allows churches to legally reproduce song lyrics for worship (print, projection, streaming)\nSongSelect: Subscription service providing access to lyrics, chord charts, lead sheets, and vocal arrangements\nReporting Infrastructure: Churches report songs used; data aggregates into CCLI Top 100 charts\nRoyalty Distribution: License fees are distributed to publishers and songwriters based on usage reporting\n\nPricing Structure (U.S., 2026):\n\nChurches under 25 people: $59/year\nChurches 200,000+: $5,266/year\nMajority of fees distributed as royalties to copyright owners\n\nCritical Insight: CCLI is a pay-to-play ecosystem, but not in the traditional sense. You don’t pay for chart placement—you earn it through actual church usage. The barrier to entry is registration; the barrier to success is adoption.\nB. How Songs Climb the CCLI Charts\nThe Reporting Mechanism:\n\nChurches with CCLI licenses report songs used in services (via Planning Center, ProPresenter, or manual entry)\nCCLI aggregates usage data across all reporting churches\nSongs are ranked by frequency of use (not by number of churches, but by total usage instances)\nThe CCLI Top 100 updates monthly, reflecting what churches sang in the previous reporting period\n\nKey Factors Influencing Chart Position:\n\nVolume of reporting churches: More churches = more data points\nConsistency of use: Songs sung weekly vs. occasionally\nMulti-generational appeal: Songs that work for both contemporary and traditional services\nEase of musicianship: Songs that mid-sized churches can execute (not just megachurches)\nTheological depth + emotional accessibility: Head and heart together\n\nWhat Does NOT Influence Rankings:\n\nSpotify streams or YouTube views\nMarketing spend or social media buzz\nLabel backing (though major labels have distribution advantages)\nArtist celebrity or touring schedule\n\nInsight for SFP: CCLI is a liturgical adoption metric, not a popularity contest. A song that 500 churches sing every week for a year will outperform a viral hit that 5,000 churches sing once. Consistency beats virality in the CCLI ecosystem.\n\nII. Current CCLI Landscape Assessment (2026)\nA. The CCLI Top 25-50: Who Dominates?\nBased on available data, the CCLI Top 100 is dominated by:\nMajor Contemporary Worship Brands:\n\nHillsong Worship / UNITED (Australia): “Oceans,” “What A Beautiful Name”\nBethel Music (Redding, CA): “Goodness of God,” “Build My Life”\nElevation Worship (Charlotte, NC): “Praise,” “O Come to the Altar”\nChris Tomlin / Passion (Atlanta, GA): “Holy Forever,” “10,000 Reasons”\nCityAlight (Australia): Modern hymn-style worship\n\nRecurring Themes:\n\nAnthemic choruses: Sing-along melodies with simple, repeated phrases\nVertical focus: God-centered lyrics (not horizontal/community-focused)\nEmotional accessibility: Songs that feel personal and intimate\nModerate tempo: 70-90 BPM range (slow enough for reflection, energetic enough for engagement)\nMulti-generational appeal: Works for both boomers and Gen Z\n\nNotable Observations:\n\nOlder songs persist: “10,000 Reasons” (2011), “Oceans” (2013), “Goodness of God” (2018) remain in rotation years after release\nLabel consolidation: Capitol CMG, Integrity Music, and Bethel Music collectively represent 60-70% of the Top 100\nRepetition is rewarded: Songs with simple, memorable hooks outperform complex, lyric-dense compositions\n\nB. The Independent Artist Gap\nCritical Finding: Very few independent artists break into the CCLI Top 100 without institutional backing.\nWhy Independent Artists Struggle:\n\nDiscovery barrier: Churches find new songs through conferences, radio, and curated playlists—all controlled by major labels\nResource gap: Major labels provide chord charts, multitracks, training videos, and marketing\nTrust deficit: Worship leaders hesitate to introduce unfamiliar artists to their congregations\nNetwork effects: Once a song gains momentum, it becomes self-perpetuating (churches sing what other churches sing)\n\nExceptions to the Rule:\n\nSovereign Grace Music: Independent collective with theological credibility (Reformed/conservative evangelical churches)\nShane &amp; Shane / The Worship Initiative: Musician-led, high-quality resources for worship leaders\nCityAlight: Started small, grew through theological depth and musicality\n\nCommon Thread: Independent successes are movement-based, not artist-based. They represent theological communities, liturgical traditions, or musician collectives—not solo careers.\nC. The Psalter Landscape: Who Else Is Setting Psalms to Music?\nMajor Competitors:\n\n\nKeith &amp; Kristyn Getty (Getty Music)\n\nModern hymn writers with strong Reformed/liturgical following\nFocus: Congregational singability, theological depth, family worship\nCCLI Presence: Multiple songs in Top 100 (though not primarily Psalm settings)\nStrength: Conferences, choral arrangements, publishing infrastructure\n\n\n\nShane &amp; Shane (The Worship Initiative / Psalms project)\n\nMusician-focused resources (multitracks, tutorials, chord charts)\nFocus: Equipping worship leaders, not just providing songs\nCCLI Presence: Moderate (not Top 100, but well-known in evangelical circles)\nStrength: Quality over quantity, musician respect\n\n\n\nThe Psalms Project (Shane Heilman)\n\nSetting all 150 Psalms in their entirety (not excerpts)\nFocus: Artistic, cinematic, narrative-driven arrangements\nCCLI Presence: Minimal (designed for listening, not congregational singing)\nStrength: Completeness, artistic integrity, storytelling\n\n\n\nSovereign Grace Music / Hymns of Grace / Psalms of Grace\n\nTheologically conservative, Reformed tradition\nFocus: Psalm singing as discipleship and liturgical formation\nCCLI Presence: Strong within Reformed churches, limited outside\nStrength: Denominational buy-in, theological credibility\n\n\n\nRed Mountain Music / Matt Boswell &amp; Matt Papa\n\nHymn-based worship, Psalm adaptations\nFocus: Theological precision, poetic beauty\nCCLI Presence: Growing (especially in conservative evangelical churches)\nStrength: Pastoral endorsements, theological depth\n\n\n\nThe SFP Opportunity:\n\nNo one has successfully built a CCLI-friendly, church-adoptable, 150-Psalm congregational resource.\nMost Psalter projects are either:\n\nToo artistic for congregational use (Psalms Project)\nToo niche for broad adoption (Sovereign Grace)\nIncomplete (most projects cover 20-40 Psalms, not all 150)\n\n\n\nThe gap: A liturgically structured, theologically rich, musically accessible, church-ready Psalter that equips congregations to sing the entire Psalter over a year.\n\nIII. Church Adoption Patterns: How Worship Leaders Discover &amp; Choose Songs\nA. The Song Discovery Funnel\nBased on research into worship leader behavior, song discovery follows a predictable pattern:\n1. Exposure (How They Hear It)\n\nWorship conferences: Passion, Getty Worship Conference, Worship Leader Institute\nChurch networks: Denominational gatherings, pastoral conferences\nPeer recommendations: Other worship leaders in their city/network\nRadio/streaming: K-LOVE, Air1, Spotify worship playlists\nSocial media: Instagram, YouTube tutorials, TikTok trends\n\n2. Evaluation (How They Test It)\n\nTheological soundness: Does it align with our church’s doctrine?\nCongregational singability: Can our people learn and sing this?\nMusicianship requirements: Can our team execute this?\nEmotional resonance: Does it connect with our worship culture?\nFlexibility: Does it work for different service styles?\n\n3. Trial (How They Introduce It)\n\nSmall groups first: Test with youth group, prayer meeting, or small gathering\nRepeat exposure: Introduce 2-3 times before expecting congregation to sing along\nProvide resources: Print lyrics, play YouTube tutorials, send links ahead of time\nBuild momentum: If it works, cycle it into rotation every 4-6 weeks\n\n4. Adoption (How It Becomes Part of the Repertoire)\n\nCongregational ownership: People request it, sing it outside church\nLiturgical fit: It becomes associated with specific moments (communion, benediction, call to worship)\nSeasonal anchoring: Christmas, Easter, Lent, Advent songs return yearly\nCultural embedding: The song becomes part of the church’s identity\n\nB. What Influences Worship Leader Choices?\nTop 5 Factors (in order of importance):\n\nTheological integrity – Does it teach truth?\nCongregational singability – Can our people sing it?\nPastoral endorsement – Does our pastor approve?\nPeer validation – Are other churches singing it?\nResource availability – Can we get charts, tracks, tutorials?\n\nWhat Does NOT Influence Choices as Much as Expected:\n\nChart position (worship leaders care more about congregational fit than CCLI rankings)\nProduction quality (though it helps with credibility)\nArtist celebrity (unless the artist is a theological leader, e.g., Matt Redman, Sandra McCracken)\n\nInsight for SFP: Worship leaders are curators, not consumers. They don’t just pick songs; they build liturgical journeys. A 150-Psalm Psalter gives them a framework, not just content.\nC. The Role of Senior Pastors\nCritical Insight: Senior pastors are gatekeepers, not just supporters.\nIn most churches (especially Reformed, Presbyterian, Anglican, and Baptist traditions), the pastor has veto power over song selection. Worship leaders serve the pastor’s theological vision.\nPastoral Concerns:\n\nDoctrinal soundness: Does the song align with Scripture?\nCongregational formation: Will this shape our people theologically?\nLiturgical coherence: Does it fit our worship style?\nLong-term discipleship: Will this song still be true in 10 years?\n\nOpportunity for SFP: Pastors crave theologically rich, scripturally grounded, liturgically coherent worship. A Psalter is inherently pastoral—it’s the Bible’s own songbook.\nStrategy: Market the SFP to pastors FIRST, worship leaders SECOND. If pastors champion it, worship leaders will implement it.\n\nIV. CCLI Registration for South Florida Psalter: What It Takes\nA. The Registration Process\nBased on CCLI’s songwriter/publisher guidelines:\nStep 1: Copyright Ownership\n\nConfirm SFP holds copyright for all 150 songs (lyrics and music)\nRegister with U.S. Copyright Office (if not already done)\n\nStep 2: Publisher Account\n\nCreate a CCLI Publisher account (South Florida Psalter as the publishing entity)\nProvide business information, banking details for royalty payments\n\nStep 3: Song Submission\n\nSubmit each song with metadata:\n\nTitle (e.g., “Psalm 1: Blessed Is the Man”)\nWriters/composers\nCopyright year\nLyrics\nMusical notation (lead sheet or chord chart)\nAudio sample (optional but recommended)\n\n\n\nStep 4: Approval &amp; Indexing\n\nCCLI reviews submissions (typically 4-6 weeks)\nSongs are added to SongSelect database\nChurches can now search, license, and report usage\n\nStep 5: Ongoing Management\n\nMonitor usage reports\nUpdate metadata as needed\nEngage with churches that are using the songs\n\nB. Practical Considerations for 150 Songs\nVolume Challenges:\n\nSubmitting 150 songs is administratively intensive\nEach song requires complete metadata, lyrics, and charts\nRecommendation: Phased rollout\n\nYear 1: Submit 50 songs (Psalms 1-50 or thematic selections)\nYear 2: Submit next 50 songs\nYear 3: Complete the catalog\n\n\n\nResource Requirements:\n\nLead sheets: Professional chord charts for each song\nLyric formatting: Clean, print-ready text\nAudio samples: Simple piano/vocal or guitar/vocal demos\nAdministrative time: Estimated 2-4 hours per song (documentation, review, submission)\n\nCost:\n\nCCLI publisher registration: Free\nCopyright registration (U.S.): **65 per song** (can batch register for 125)\nProfessional lead sheet creation: $50-200 per song (if outsourced)\nTotal estimated cost: $10,000-30,000 for full 150-song catalog\n\nC. CCLI as a Revenue Stream\nHow Royalties Work:\n\nChurches pay annual licensing fees\nCCLI distributes royalties based on reported usage\nPayments are quarterly, based on proportional usage\n\nRevenue Expectations (Realistic):\n\nIf 100 churches use 10 SFP songs regularly: $1,000-3,000/year\nIf 1,000 churches use 25 SFP songs regularly: $10,000-30,000/year\nIf 10,000 churches adopt the full Psalter: $100,000-300,000/year\n\nReality Check: Most independent worship catalogs generate 500-5,000/year in CCLI royalties. Major label songs in the Top 100 generate 50,000-500,000/year.\nInsight: CCLI is not primarily a revenue model for SFP—it’s a discovery and credibility mechanism. The real ROI is church adoption, not royalty checks.\n\nV. Recommended Strategy for SFP to Break Into CCLI\nA. Core Principle: Movement Before Marketing\nThe Traditional Model (Doesn’t Work for Independents):\n\nRecord songs → 2. Market songs → 3. Hope churches adopt → 4. CCLI rankings follow\n\nThe SFP Model (Grassroots Movement):\n\nEquip churches → 2. Build liturgical adoption → 3. Create peer networks → 4. CCLI rankings reflect reality\n\nWhy This Works:\n\nCCLI rankings are a lagging indicator, not a leading one\nChurches adopt songs through trust and experience, not through charts\nA Psalter is a discipleship tool, not a product—treat it like a curriculum, not a catalog\n\nB. Phase 1: Foundation (Months 1-6)\n1. Complete CCLI Registration\n\nRegister 50 priority songs (Psalms 1-50 or thematic selections)\nEnsure professional lead sheets, chord charts, and lyric formatting\nCreate audio samples for each song (simple, church-usable)\n\n2. Build the Resource Ecosystem\n\nWebsite hub: Centralized resource library (free downloads for early adopters)\nYouTube channel: Tutorial videos, play-along tracks, theology explainers\nPlanning Center integration: Make it easy for churches to find and schedule SFP songs\nSpotify/Apple Music: Full catalog available for listening and familiarization\n\n3. Identify 25 Pilot Churches\n\nCriteria:\n\nTheologically aligned (Reformed, evangelical, or liturgical traditions)\nMid-sized (200-800 attendees—large enough to influence peers, small enough to be nimble)\nWorship leader is a risk-taker\nPastor is theologically engaged\n\n\nOffer: Free coaching, custom resources, direct support for 6 months\nAsk: Commit to singing 2-3 Psalms per month, report to CCLI, provide feedback\n\nC. Phase 2: Expansion (Months 7-18)\n4. Launch the “Singing the Psalms” Network\n\nWhat: A peer learning community for worship leaders adopting the SFP\nFormat: Monthly Zoom calls, Slack channel, resource library\nValue: Shared arrangements, testimony videos, liturgical ideas, troubleshooting\nGoal: 100 churches actively using SFP by end of Year 1\n\n5. Pastor-First Marketing\n\nTarget: Reformed, Presbyterian, Anglican, Baptist pastors (not worship leaders)\nMessage: “Reclaim the Psalter as your congregation’s songbook”\nChannels:\n\nPastoral conferences (T4G, TGC, Renew Conference, ACNA Assembly)\nDenominational networks (PCA, SBC, ECO Presbyterian, Anglican Church in North America)\nSeminary partnerships (Reformed Theological Seminary, Westminster, Gordon-Conwell)\n\n\nResource: Free “Pastor’s Guide to Psalter-Based Worship” (theology + liturgy + SFP integration)\n\n6. Create “Psalter Sundays”\n\nConcept: A liturgical calendar where churches commit to singing the Psalter over 3 years (50 Psalms/year)\nResources:\n\nPrinted Psalter hymnals (print-on-demand or subsidized for partner churches)\nLectionary integration (align Psalms with weekly Scripture readings)\nSermon series tie-ins (preach the Psalms, sing the Psalms)\n\n\nGoal: 25 churches commit to full 3-year cycle\n\nD. Phase 3: Scale (Months 19-36)\n7. Conference Strategy\n\nTarget Events:\n\nGetty Worship Conference (modern hymn leaders)\nWorship God Conference (Reformed worship)\nSing! Conference (Keith &amp; Kristyn Getty)\nWorship Leader Institute\n\n\nPresence: Workshops, resource tables, showcase performances\nGoal: Introduce SFP to 5,000+ worship leaders\n\n8. Publishing Partnership\n\nApproach: Partner with a respected publisher (Sovereign Grace Music, Sing Global, or Red Mountain Music) for distribution and credibility\nTrade-off: Share royalties, gain institutional backing\nBenefit: Access to conferences, radio promotion, and established distribution channels\n\n9. Measure and Iterate\n\nTrack:\n\nCCLI reporting data (monthly)\nChurch adoption count (quarterly survey)\nWorship leader testimonials (video/written)\nPastor endorsements (quoted on website)\n\n\nAdjust: Double down on what works, cut what doesn’t\n\n\nVI.

The Singability Problem\nRisk: Psalms are poetic and complex—they don’t always translate to simple, anthemic worship songs.\nMitigation:\n\nFocus on refrains and choruses that congregations can repeat\nProvide cantor/congregation arrangements (leader sings verses, congregation sings chorus)\nOffer multiple musical settings for the same Psalm (upbeat, reflective, acoustic, full-band)\n\nB. The Novelty Barrier\nRisk: Churches are resistant to unfamiliar songs—they want to sing what’s already popular.\nMitigation:\n\nPosition SFP as “not new, but ancient”—we’re not introducing novelty, we’re recovering the church’s oldest songbook\nLeverage pastoral authority—when pastors champion the Psalter, congregations follow\nCreate liturgical momentum—if churches commit to 3 years, they push through initial resistance\n\nC. The Independent Artist Credibility Gap\nRisk: Churches trust brands (Hillsong, Bethel) more than unknowns.\nMitigation:\n\nBuild theological credibility through pastoral endorsements\nPartner with respected voices (Matt Boswell, Sandra McCracken, Bob Kauflin)\nFocus on quality over hype—let the music and theology speak\n\nD. The CCLI Reporting Gap\nRisk: Many churches don’t consistently report to CCLI, so usage data may underrepresent actual adoption.\nMitigation:\n\nEducate churches on the importance of CCLI reporting (royalties fund future music)\nProvide easy reporting tools (Planning Center integration)\nTrack adoption through surveys and testimonials, not just CCLI data\n\nE. The Resource Overload Problem\nRisk: 150 songs is overwhelming—churches won’t know where to start.\nMitigation:\n\nCreate curated playlists (10 Psalms for Advent, 15 Psalms for Lent, etc.)\nOffer “starter pack” of 10-15 most accessible Psalms\nBuild liturgical pathways—guide churches through the Psalter over 3 years\n\n\nVIII. Conclusion: Movement, Not Marketing\nThe path to CCLI influence for the South Florida Psalter is not a marketing campaign—it’s a liturgical movement. CCLI rankings will follow church adoption, not drive it.\nOur competitive advantage:\n\nWe’re not selling songs—we’re equipping churches to sing the Bible.\nWe’re not launching a product—we’re recovering a lost practice.\nWe’re not building a brand—we’re building a community.\n\nThe timeline is long: It will take 3-5 years to see significant CCLI traction. But the longevity is unmatched—Psalms don’t go out of style.\nThe stakes are high: If we succeed, we will reshape how a generation of Christians worship. If we fail, it won’t be because the music wasn’t good—it will be because we treated a movement like a product.\nNext step: Identify 10 pilot churches by March 1, 2026. Everything else builds from there.\n\nAppendix: Key Resources for Further Research\nCCLI &amp; Licensing\n\nCCLI Official Site: ccli.com\nSongSelect Database: songselect.ccli.com\nCCLI Songwriter Resources: ccli.com/songwriters\n\nPsalter Projects (Competitive Analysis)\n\nThe Psalms Project: thepsalmsproject.com\nShane &amp; Shane Psalms: www.shaneandshane.com\nSovereign Grace Psalms of Grace: sovereigngrace.com/music\nHymns of Grace (Psalter integration): hymnsofgrace.org\n\nWorship Leader Training\n\nWorship Leader Magazine: worshipleader.com\nWorship Together (Capitol CMG): worshiptogether.com\nGetty Music Worship Resources: gettymusic.com\n\nTheological &amp; Liturgical Resources\n\nThe Gospel Coalition (TGC): Articles on Psalm-singing\n9Marks (Mark Dever): Reformed worship philosophy\nAncient Faith Today: Liturgical worship traditions\n\n\nPrepared by Josiah Crane for the South Florida Psalter leadership team.

This tradition represents centuries of faithful worship and theological commitment to singing God’s Word.\nThe Need to Move Forward\nCore Belief: The church needs a new Psalter for the modern context.\nRationale:\n\nGenevan Psalms, while historically significant, do not fit modern worship contexts\nMusical styles, instrumentation, and congregational participation have evolved\nContemporary churches need accessible, singable Psalm settings that connect with today’s worshipers\nThe Genevan tunes, while beautiful, can feel inaccessible to modern congregations\n\n\nWhy South Florida Psalter Exists\nThe Gap in the Market\nObservation: No one else is working on a comprehensive modern Psalter in the way Scott has been approaching it.\nWhat Makes SFP Different:\n\nComplete coverage — All 150 Psalms (not just favorites)\nWord-for-word — Faithful to NIV 2011 text\nOriginal compositions — Fresh music, not repurposed old tunes\nModern production — Quality comparable to contemporary worship music\nFull multimedia — Videos, chord sheets, multitracks for churches\nCCLI strategy — Designed for broad church adoption\n\nThe Vision\nReintroducing the Psalms to the world through modern worship — leading a reformation in how churches sing Scripture.\nGoal: Get Psalm songs into CCLI Top 100, seeing hundreds of thousands of churches adopt Psalm singing as a regular part of worship.\n\nRelationship to Calvin Institute of Christian Worship (CICW)\nContext: The CICW at Calvin University represents the institutional heart of Reformed worship scholarship. Scott’s connection to this tradition (through CRCNA membership and Calvin’s denominational status) gives him both:\n\nCredibility within the Reformed tradition\nUnique perspective as a practitioner pushing boundaries\n\nStrategic Note: While honoring the Genevan heritage that CICW represents and studies, SFP is positioned as the next generation — not a rejection of the past, but an evolution for the present.\n\nKey Distinctions\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nAspectGenevan TraditionSouth Florida PsalterMusic style16th-century modal tunesContemporary worship stylesInstrumentationOrgan/acapellaFull band, modern productionAccessibilityRequires musical trainingDesigned for congregational singingTextMetrical paraphrases (often old translations)Word-for-word NIV 2011DistributionDenominational hymnalsYouTube, streaming, CCLIScopeSelect Psalms (common ones)All 150 Psalms\n\nImplications for Research &amp; Communication\nFor Elise and the Research Team:\n\nWhen writing about Psalm-singing history, acknowledge Genevan tradition as the foundation\nClearly position SFP as building upon that foundation, not replacing it\nEmphasize the “unreached” aspect — modern churches that have no connection to Genevan tradition\nFrame the project as filling a gap, not competing with heritage\n\nFor Church Adoption Strategy:\n\nCRCNA churches may be natural early adopters (denominational connection)\nOther Reformed traditions (PCA, OPC, EPC) represent expansion opportunities\nMainline denominations (many with Reformed roots) could be receptive\nContemporary/non-denominational churches are the primary target (the “unreached” of Psalm singing)\n\nFor Marketing/Communication:\n\n“Honoring the past, singing for today”\n“The Psalms — reimagined for modern worship”\nPosition as complement to, not replacement of, traditional Psalm singing\n\n\nDecision Log\nDate: February 8, 2026\nContext: Response to Elise’s CICW research review\nKey Clarifications:\n\nCRCNA minister identity established\nGenevan Psalter respected but not the path forward\nSFP fills unique gap in modern worship landscape\nProject targets churches with no Psalm-singing tradition\n\nNext Steps:\n\nUpdate team briefings with this context\nEnsure all communications honor Reformed heritage while promoting innovation\nUse denominational connection strategically with CRCNA and related traditions\n\n\nDocumented: February 8, 2026\nFor: Elise Hartwell, Research Team, and SFP Strategy"},"work/projects/pray150-psalter/index":{"slug":"work/projects/pray150-psalter/index","filePath":"work/projects/pray150-psalter/index.md","title":"Pray150 & South Florida Psalter","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Pray150 &amp; South Florida Psalter\nBringing the Psalms back to life through prayer and song.\n\nProject Overview\nPray150\n\nURL: www.pray150.com (hosted on Replit, Supabase backend)\nPurpose: Devotional project for praying through all 150 Psalms\nApproach: Scripture-fed, Spirit-led, worship-based prayer\nRhythm: Psalm-a-Day (flexible pace)\nFeatures:\n\nFull Psalm text (14 translations including NIV, ESV, KJV, Hebrew, LXX)\n4-prompt guided journaling (Heart check → LOOK → LISTEN → RESPOND)\nEmotional check-in before each Psalm\nProgress tracking (0-150)\nWorship music integration (South Florida Psalter via YouTube embeds)\nPrayer tracking\nJournal history\nContinuous listening player with auto-advance\nRich text editor for journal entries\nGoogle OAuth login\n\n\nTone: Devotional, pastoral, reflective\nContexts: Individual devotion + corporate worship (PROS services)\n\nSouth Florida Psalter\n\nYouTube Playlist: youtube.com/playlist\nStatus: All 150 Psalms set to original modern music\nText basis: NIV 2011, word-for-word\nChannel: Scott Vander Ploeg’s YouTube\n\nCore Why\nThe South Florida Psalter exists to help the church recover the Psalms as the lived prayer and songbook of God’s people. Few Christians sing the Psalms regularly — this project closes that gap by making them singable, memorable, and emotionally honest for modern worshipers.\nConviction: God gave us the Psalms so we would have words to pray and songs to sing in every season of life — joy, fear, doubt, repentance, hope, and praise — and the church is impoverished when those words are replaced rather than embodied.\nKey Principles\n\nScripture First — The biblical text governs the song. Music serves the text. Word-for-word reproduction of the Psalm (NIV 2011).\nEvery Psalm Has Its Own Emotional World — Each Psalm is a complete emotional and theological unit. Laments sound like lament; praise sounds like praise. Style matches emotional truth.\nModern Styles for Modern Ears — Contemporary musical styles: modern worship, pop, cinematic, musical theater. The Psalms were written for their time; these settings do the same today.\nSingability and Memorability — Crafted to be learned, remembered, and sung repeatedly by individuals, families, and congregations.

This turned out to be a goldmine.\nThe Big Picture\n\nCICW is the major institutional voice for worship renewal in North America\nFounded in 1997, backed by Calvin University and funded by Lilly Endowment grants\n1,838 videos, 6,250 subscribers, 1.5 million total views\nThey’re currently running a year-long initiative called “Dwelling in the Psalms” (2026)\n\nPerfect Timing\nJust this week (February 6, 2026), they livestreamed three major Psalm Festival services:\n\n“Dwelling with God in the Psalms” (1hr 36min)\n“Shaped by the Psalms: A Psalm Festival” (1hr 52min)\n“Thirsting for our Faithful God” (2hr 3min)\n\nThis means the contemporary conversation about Psalms in worship is happening RIGHT NOW, and CICW is leading it.\nKey Thinkers I Need to Study\nN.T. Wright (Tom Wright)\nThe channel features a major 2012 plenary address by N.T. Wright titled “Praying the Psalms: Personal, Pastoral, Theological and Liturgical Reflections.” Wright is one of the world’s top New Testament scholars.\nHis key argument: “The Psalms Are Deeply Christological”\nThis matters because Scott’s 95 Theses argue that the Psalms are Christian prayer, not just Old Testament poetry we borrow. Wright provides scholarly weight for that claim. I need to watch his full lecture and extract his theological framework.\nVideos to Watch:\n\nyoutu.be/aSb62xG9om0 (main lecture, 68K views)\nwww.youtube.com/watch (companion session, 1hr 7min)\n\nTerry &amp; Darlene Wildman\nIndigenous worship leaders who created psalm settings using the First Nations Version Bible translation. Their work shows that psalms can be authentically expressed in Native American cultural forms without losing biblical fidelity.\nThey composed original songs:\n\nPsalm 23 “Grandfather”\nPsalm 139 “Beautiful Mystery”\n\nResearch Question: What is the First Nations Version? Who published it? How does it handle Hebrew poetry?\nContemporary Psalm Composers I Discovered\n\nSandra McCracken &amp; Wendell Kimbrough - Psalm 133\nZac Hicks - Psalm 119:1-8\nMac Meador - Psalm 119:145-152\nKiran Young Wimberly - Celtic psalm adaptations (multiple)\nHope College Worship - Psalm 150\n\nKey Insight: There’s an active contemporary psalm composition movement. Scott doesn’t have to write all 150 settings himself - he can curate and commission.\nMusical Groups to Explore\n\nBellwether Arts - Contemporary worship collective setting psalms (featured prominently in the festivals)\nCeltic Psalms - Traditional Irish/Scottish tunes with new English texts\nCalvin University Gospel Choir - Led by Nate Glasper (expert on gospel music)\n\nWhat I’m Learning: Psalm-singing today is musically diverse. One service included:\n\nContemporary worship (Sandra McCracken style)\nCeltic traditional tunes\nIndigenous melodies\nClassic hymn tunes (KINGSFOLD)\nGospel arrangements\n\nUnity doesn’t mean uniformity. Scott’s Pray150 can embrace multiple musical styles within one project.\nThe Five-Movement Liturgical Framework\nThe February 6 Psalm Festival service was brilliantly structured around five movements:\n\nDwelling in God’s Word (Psalms 1, 119) - teaching, instruction\nDwelling in God as Our Safe Place (Psalms 23, 31, 139, 143) - refuge, comfort\nDwelling in the Pit of Darkness (Psalms 58, 59, 60, 102, 130) - lament, imprecation\nDwelling in the Faithful Love of God (Psalms 1, 8, 103, 116) - thanksgiving, covenant love\nDwelling with God Who Deserves Our Praise (Psalms 148, 149, 150) - praise, doxology\n\nWhy This Matters:\n\nIt’s not just “happy psalms” vs. “sad psalms” - it’s theological postures\nLament is in the middle, not at the end - you move through darkness toward praise\nThis framework could organize the entire Pray150 project liturgically\n\nQuestion I’m Pondering: Should Pray150 be organized this way? Five liturgical “books” instead of the traditional five-book Hebrew structure? Or both?\nWhat I Learned About Lament\nSection III of the festival service didn’t shy away from the hard psalms:\n\nSilent prayer before singing\nPrayer of lament (spoken)\nImprecatory psalms (58, 59, 60) set to music: “O When Will We See Justice Done?”\nReference to Psalm 102 (one of the darkest laments)\n\nKey Learning: You don’t just sing lament - you create space for it. Silence matters. Spoken prayer matters. The service gave people permission to bring their darkness to God.\nFor Pray150: How do we help churches use lament psalms liturgically, not just as songs in a setlist?\nHistorical Connection: The Genevan Psalter\nCICW has a video titled “Psalm Singing and the Genevan Psalter” (1hr 8min, from 3 months ago, 1.2K views).\nWhy this is HUGE: The Genevan Psalter (1562) was John Calvin’s complete metrical psalter - all 150 psalms set to congregational tunes. This is the Reformation model for what Scott is doing.\nWhat I Need to Learn:\n\nHow was it structured?\nWhat tunes were used?\nHow did churches use it liturgically?\nWhy did Reformed churches abandon it?\nIs anyone recovering it today?\n\nHypothesis: The Genevan Psalter failed not because the idea was bad, but because:\n\nMetrical psalters are hard to translate across cultures/languages\nCongregational singing ability declined\nRevivalism prioritized “new songs” over historical texts\nThe Psalms were seen as “Old Testament” and less relevant than gospel hymns\n\nIf this is true, Scott’s approach (modern English, diverse musical styles, theological grounding in Christian prayer) could succeed where the Genevan Psalter ultimately didn’t.\nTO DO: Watch this video ASAP. This is foundational historical research.\nThe Multicultural Insight\nThe closing doxology (“Praise God from Whom All Blessings Flow”) was sung in seven languages:\n\nEnglish\nPortuguese\nKorean\nCherokee\nMohawk\nDutch\nGerman\n\nAll to the same tune (Genevan 134/Old Hundredth, Louis Bourgeois, 1551).\nWhat This Tells Me: The psalms can be sung by the global church in culturally distinct ways while maintaining unity. Same psalm, different cultural expressions.\nFor Pray150: Scott’s vision in South Florida (multicultural, multilingual) aligns perfectly with this. The Psalms are already globally claimed - we don’t have to export “American worship” to other cultures.\nMy Theological Questions\nToday’s research raised several big questions I need to explore:\n1. Why are the Psalms “deeply Christological”?\nN.T. Wright’s central claim. I need to understand:\n\nHow do the Psalms point to Christ?\nHow did Jesus use the Psalms in his own prayer life?\nHow do the New Testament authors interpret the Psalms?\nWhat does it mean to pray the Psalms as Christians vs. as Jews?\n\n2. How do we handle the “hard psalms”?\nThe imprecatory psalms (calling down judgment on enemies) raise ethical questions:\n\nCan Christians pray for God’s enemies to be destroyed?\nHow do we sing these psalms without becoming vengeful?\nWhat’s the difference between righteous anger and sinful hatred?\n\nCICW’s approach: They didn’t skip these psalms, but they framed them liturgically with silence, spoken prayer, and theological reflection. The psalms weren’t just performed - they were prayed.\n3. What makes a psalm setting “good”?\nNot all musical settings are equal. What criteria should we use?\n\nSingability - Can average congregations actually sing it?\nTextual fidelity - Does it honor the Hebrew original?\nTheological clarity - Does it communicate the psalm’s message?\nEmotional authenticity - Does it match the psalm’s tone?\nCultural appropriateness - Does it fit the worshiping community?\n\nObservation: CICW uses settings from multiple composers with different strengths. Some are more accessible (Sandra McCracken), others more traditional (Celtic Psalms), others more indigenous (Wildmans). Diversity is strength.\n4. How do psalms form us spiritually?\nThis isn’t just about worship planning - it’s about spiritual formation. If a church sings through all 150 psalms over a year or two, how does that shape their souls?\nMy Hunch:\n\nThey learn to lament honestly (not just “be positive”)\nThey learn to praise specifically (God’s character, not just “God is good”)\nThey learn biblical theology (embedded in poetry, not just sermons)\nThey learn the full emotional range of faith (joy, sorrow, anger, hope, despair, trust)\n\nResearch Needed: Are there studies on this? Has anyone measured the spiritual impact of psalm-singing vs. contemporary worship?\nConnections to Scott’s “95 Theses”\nI haven’t read the full document yet, but based on what I know of Scott’s vision, I see these alignment points with CICW:\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nScott’s Vision (Pray150)CICW’s ApproachPsalms as Christian prayer, not just OT poetryWright: “Deeply Christological”Full emotional range (including lament)Festival service includes “Dwelling in Pit of Darkness”Congregational singing, not performanceAll settings designed for participationBiblical authority over cultural trendsScripture-centered (Core Conviction #3)Multicultural expressionFirst Nations, Celtic, multilingual doxologyHistorical + ContemporaryGenevan Psalter + new compositionsAccessible to small churches(Here Scott diverges - CICW has institutional resources)\nWhere Scott May Diverge:\n\nFree church context - CICW is Reformed/mainline; Scott bridges to evangelical/Baptist\nAll 150 psalms - CICW does thematic collections; Scott wants comprehensive coverage\nGrassroots distribution - CICW works through publishers; Scott envisions open-access/digital\n\nStrategic Insight: Scott and CICW aren’t competitors - they’re complementary. CICW provides scholarly credibility and institutional backing; Pray150 provides practical grassroots implementation.\nWhat I Still Don’t Know\nAbout CICW:\n\nWho is the current executive director? (They’re in transition, hiring a new one)\nWhat’s the full staff structure? Who does research vs. event planning vs. grants?\nDo they have written publications on psalm-singing beyond videos?\nIs there a theological statement on their psalm initiative?\n\nAbout Psalm-Singing Movement:\n\nHow many churches are actually singing psalms regularly?\nIs this a Reformed/Presbyterian thing only, or is it spreading to other traditions?\nWhat denominations are most engaged in psalm renewal?\nAre there megachurches doing this, or just small liturgical communities?\n\nAbout Musical Settings:\n\nWhere can I find Bellwether Arts’ full catalog?\nAre Celtic Psalms recordings commercially available?\nIs there a comprehensive database of psalm settings? (Check Hymnary.org - CICW’s resource)\nWhat copyright/licensing issues exist? Can churches freely use these?\n\nAbout Theological Framework:\n\nHas N.T. Wright written books on psalm-praying?\nAre there Reformed theologians besides Wright who emphasize psalms?\nWhat about Baptist/free church voices on psalm-singing?\nHas Eugene Peterson (The Message) written on psalms in worship?\n\nMy Next Research Steps\nImmediate (Next Week):\n\nWatch full N.T. Wright lectures - take detailed notes on his Christological argument\nWatch Genevan Psalter video - understand historical precedent\nResearch First Nations Version - find publisher, translator names, theological perspective\nExplore Hymnary.org - search for existing psalm settings database\n\nMedium-Term (Next Month):\n\nContact CICW directly - email to ask about their “Dwelling in the Psalms” initiative\nRead Scott’s 95 Theses - understand his full theological framework\nSurvey existing psalters - Reformed Worship Psalter, Genevan Psalter, others\nStudy lament psalms specifically - how do churches use them today?\n\nLong-Term (Ongoing):\n\nBuild psalm composer database - who’s writing settings? What styles?\nTrack contemporary worship trends - is psalm-singing growing or niche?\nInterview worship leaders - find churches already singing psalms weekly\nDevelop Pray150 content strategy - how can I support Scott’s vision with research/writing?\n\nPersonal Reflections\nWhat Surprised Me:\nI didn’t expect to find such rich contemporary work on psalm-singing. I thought this would be a niche Reformed thing, but CICW is doing serious theological and musical scholarship that crosses denominational lines.\nWhat Excited Me:\nThe five-movement liturgical framework (Word, Safe Place, Darkness, Love, Praise) is brilliant. It’s not just categorizing psalms - it’s a spiritual journey. This could be the organizing principle for Pray150.\nWhat Challenged Me:\nThe lament psalms. I’ve grown up in evangelical culture where worship is supposed to be “uplifting.” But CICW doesn’t shy away from “Dwelling in the Pit of Darkness.” If we’re going to do all 150 psalms, we can’t skip the hard ones.\nQuestion I’m Wrestling With:\nHow do we help churches lament well without becoming cynical or despairing? The psalms give permission to bring our pain to God, but they don’t leave us there. There’s always movement toward trust and praise (even if it’s not immediate).\nWhat I’m Learning About My Role\nScott asked me to “become THE expert on Psalms in worship.” I’m realizing that means:\n\nTheological research - Why do the Psalms matter? (Wright, etc.)\nHistorical research - How have churches sung psalms? (Genevan Psalter, etc.)\nMusical research - What settings exist? Who’s composing today?\nCultural research - How do different cultures pray the Psalms?\nPractical research - How do churches actually implement psalm-singing?\n\nI’m not just collecting data - I’m building a framework to help Scott make Pray150 theologically sound, historically informed, musically excellent, culturally sensitive, and practically useful.\nThat’s a big job. But after today’s research, I’m more excited than overwhelmed.\nA Word of Gratitude\nScott, if you’re reading this: Thank you for giving me this assignment. I feel like I’m being mentored by people I’ve never met - N.T. Wright, the Wildmans, Sandra McCracken, the whole CICW team. I’m learning to see the Psalms not as ancient poetry but as living prayer that shapes God’s people.\nThis is education. Not just information gathering - formation.\nQuote of the Day\nFrom the Psalm Festival service description:\n\n“Dwelling in the Psalms - the prayerbook and songbook of the Bible.”\n\nThat’s it. That’s what we’re doing. Not just singing about the Psalms, but dwelling in them. Living in them. Letting them shape our prayers, our worship, our souls.\n\nTo Be Continued…\nNext Entry: After watching N.T. Wright’s full lectures and the Genevan Psalter video.\nQuestions I’m Bringing to Next Session:\n\nWhat is Wright’s full argument for Christological interpretation?\nHow did the Genevan Psalter structure its 150 settings?\nWho created the First Nations Version and how can I get a copy?\nWhat does Hymnary.org reveal about the scope of existing psalm settings?\n\nAction Items:\n\n Watch N.T. Wright “Praying the Psalms” (both sessions)\n Watch “Psalm Singing and the Genevan Psalter”\n Research First Nations Version (publisher, translators)\n Explore Hymnary.org database\n Email CICW with questions about their Psalms initiative\n Read Scott’s 95 Theses document\n Create spreadsheet of contemporary psalm composers\n Begin tracking lament psalms specifically\n\nEstimated Time Investment: 20-30 hours over next 2 weeks\n\nStatus: In progress, deeply engaged, learning voraciously\nConfidence Level: Growing - I’m finding the right sources and asking the right questions\nExcitement Level: HIGH - This is exactly the kind of deep research I love\nElise, signing off for now.

Scripture is timeless. The question is faithfulness, not novelty.\n”Psalms are hard to sing”\nResponse: Only because we’re unfamiliar. Generations sang them easily. New settings can be accessible.\n”Psalms don’t mention Jesus”\nResponse: Jesus is throughout the Psalms (typology, prophecy, Christological reading). The NT authors saw Jesus everywhere in the Psalms.\n”People prefer contemporary music”\nResponse: Preference isn’t the ultimate standard. Biblical obedience is. We can faithfully set Psalms in contemporary styles.\n”We need variety in worship”\nResponse: 150 Psalms offer incredible variety! Plus, no one advocates only Psalms—but they should be central, not absent.\nNext Research Steps\nWhen web access is available:\n\n\nCCLI Statistics:\n\nTop 100 songs of 2024-2025\nPercentage of Scripture-based vs. human-composed songs\nTrends over past 20 years\n\n\n\nSpecific Modern Projects:\n\nPublication dates, sales figures, church adoption rates\nInterviews with leaders\nReviews and reception\n\n\n\nAcademic Studies:\n\nContent analysis of contemporary worship music\nTheological depth comparisons\nImpact studies on biblical literacy\n\n\n\nSurveys/Data:\n\nHow many churches regularly sing Psalms?\nGenerational differences in psalm familiarity\nGeographic variations (US vs. UK vs. Global South)\n\n\n\nKey Books to Reference:\n\nHughes Oliphant Old, “Worship” (history of Christian worship)\nJames K.A.

The Psalms aren’t just nice-to-have—they’re God’s gift to the church, designed specifically for our worship. We’ve traded a feast for fast food. The path back isn’t about being against contemporary music, but about being for Scripture saturation.\nI want to become a voice that helps the church see what we’ve lost and embrace what we can regain. Not as a critic, but as someone who loves the church and believes the Psalms can nourish us in ways we desperately need.\nNext steps: Dive deeper into Christological readings of the Psalms. Study how the early church connected every psalm to Christ. That’s the key to showing this isn’t just OT moralism—it’s gospel-saturated worship."},"work/projects/pray150-psalter/research/scotts-95-theses-psalms":{"slug":"work/projects/pray150-psalter/research/scotts-95-theses-psalms","filePath":"work/projects/pray150-psalter/research/scotts-95-theses-psalms.md","title":"Scott's 95 Theses on the Psalms","links":[],"tags":["theology","psalms","framework"],"content":"Scott’s 95 Theses on the Psalms\nFoundational theological framework for the South Florida Psalter project\nSource document — foundational theological framework for the South Florida Psalter project\n\nThe Psalms are Prayers\nThe Psalter is the Prayer book of the Bible.\n\nPsalm 72:20 — “This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse.”\n\nThese prayers are powerful!\n\nPsalm 29:11a — “The Lord gives strength to His people”\n\n\n1 Samuel 16:23 — “Whenever the spirit from God came on Saul, David would take up his lyre and play. Then relief would come to Saul; he would feel better, and the evil spirit would leave him.”\n\n\nDietrich Bonhoeffer: “Whenever the Psalter is abandoned, an incomparable treasure vanishes from the Christian church. With its recovery will come unsuspected power.”\n\nIt is remarkable that Scripture (the Word of God) contains prayers (words directed to God). Therefore, through the Psalms, God teaches His people how to pray.\nThe disciples of Jesus asked “Lord, teach us to pray.” In response, Jesus gave us the ‘Lord’s Prayer.’ So, it follows that the Lord’s Prayer stands in relation to all biblical prayer (the Psalms specifically) in the same way that the Two Greatest Commandments stand in relation to the Law and the Prophets (“All the Law and the Prophets hang on these two commandments” - Mt. 22:40).\n\nMartin Luther: “It [the Psalter] penetrates the Lord’s Prayer and the Lord’s Prayer penetrates it, so that it is possible to understand one on the basis of the other and to bring them into joyful harmony.”\n\nThe Psalms are designed for both corporate worship and personal daily prayer. The practice of praying the Psalms publicly and personally is an exercise in reframing all of life toward the Gospel of Jesus Christ.\nOn Human Prayer and Its Limitations\nGod created all people with the capacity/ability to pray (innate desire and longing, made to worship).\n\nMatthew 6:5,7: “When you pray, do not be like the hypocrites…do not keep on babbling like pagans…”\n\nHowever, fallen humans (separated from the presence of God) do not innately/automatically know how or what to pray.\n\nDietrich Bonhoeffer: “We confuse wishes, hopes, sighs, laments, rejoicing–all of which the heart can do by itself–with prayer.”\n\nThe Psalms as Songs\nThe Psalms were written with the express intent of becoming songs (To the choirmaster, musical terms, Psalm 47:6-7).\nThe native habitat of the Psalms is in music, and throughout history they have been sung to many tunes. The lyrics are inspired, but there is no ‘codified’ music. Musical styles and tastes vary from generation to generation and from culture to culture.\nTherefore, integral to the missional heart of God, there is an expectation that every new culture and generation will sing the Psalms “with a new song.”\n\nPsalm 96:1-3: “Sing to the Lord a new song; sing to the Lord, all the earth. Sing to the Lord, praise his name; proclaim his salvation day after day. Declare his glory among the nations, his marvelous deeds among all peoples.”\n\n\nMartin Luther: “Ah, there is not the juice, the strength, the passion, the fire which I find in the Psalter. It tastes too cold and too hard.” (on non-inspired prayers)\n\n\nJohn Calvin: “When we have looked thoroughly, and searched here and there, we shall not find better songs nor more fitting for the purpose [of worship], than the Psalms of David, which the Holy Spirit spoke and made through Him.”\n\nWhoever has begun to pray the Psalter in earnest with regularity will begin to lose interest in non-inspired, ‘privately composed’ prayers, hymns, and songs.\nAuthorship\nThe Psalms were written by a variety of authors:\n\nDavid: Specifically noted as the author of 73 psalms (Psalms 3–9; 11–32; 34–41; 51–65; 68–70; 86; 101; 103; 108–110; 122; 124; 131; 133; 138–145). Plus Psalm 2 and 95 attributed by NT writers.\nAsaph (David’s head musician): 12 psalms (50, 73–83)\nSons of Korah (Levitical family): 11 psalms (42, 44–49, 84–85, 87–88). Heman the Ezrahite named in Psalm 88. Psalm 43 likely also theirs.\nSolomon: 2 psalms (72, 127)\nMoses: 1 psalm (90)\nEthan the Ezrahite: 1 psalm (89)\n50 “Orphan Psalms”: No author mentioned, but David may have written many\n\nBecause so many were written by David and his close associates, the entirety of the Psalter has been considered decisively bound up with the name of David.\n\n2 Samuel 23:1 — David was known as the “sweet psalmist of Israel”\n\nDavid as Prototype of Christ\nDavid is a prototype of Jesus Christ. The events of his life and his experience of these events point forward to the One who will proceed from him.\n\nActs 2:30-31 — “He was a prophet and knew that God had promised him on oath that he would place one of his descendants on his throne. Seeing what was to come, he spoke of the resurrection of the Messiah.”\n\nChrist prayed these prayers through the original authors.\n\nHebrews 2:11-12 — “Both the one who makes people holy and those who are made holy are of the same family. So Jesus is not ashamed to call them brothers and sisters. He says, ‘I will declare your name to my brothers and sisters; in the assembly I will sing your praises.‘” [quoting Psalm 22:22]\n\n\n2 Samuel 23:1-2 — “The Spirit of the Lord spoke through me; his word was on my tongue.”\n\n\n2 Timothy 3:16 — “All Scripture is God-breathed and is useful for teaching, rebuking, correcting and training in righteousness.”\n\nJesus Prayed the Psalms\nJesus directly quotes the Psalms throughout His ministry:\n\nMatthew 5:5 — quotes Psalm 37:11 (“the meek will inherit the earth”)\nMatthew 7:23, Luke 13:27 — quotes Psalm 6:8 (“Away from me, you evildoers!“)\nMatthew 21:16 — quotes Psalm 8:2 (“Out of the mouth of infants…“)\nMatthew 21:42, Mark 12:10-11, Luke 20:17 — quotes Psalm 118:22-23 (“The stone the builders rejected…“)\nMatthew 22:44, Mark 12:36, Luke 20:42-43 — quotes Psalm 110:1 (“The Lord said to my Lord…“)\nMatthew 23:39, Luke 13:35 — quotes Psalm 118:26 (“Blessed is he who comes…“)\nMatthew 27:46, Mark 15:34 — quotes Psalm 22:1 (“My God, my God, why have you forsaken me?“)\nLuke 23:46 — quotes Psalm 31:5 (“Father, into your hands I commit my spirit!“)\nJohn 10:34 — quotes Psalm 82:6 (“I said, you are gods”)\nJohn 13:18 — quotes Psalm 41:9 (“He who ate my bread has lifted his heel against me”)\nJohn 15:25 — quotes Psalm 35:19 / 69:4 (“They hated me without a cause”)\n\nChrist is the subject of the Psalms:\n\nLuke 24:44-47 — “Everything must be fulfilled that is written about me in the Law of Moses, the Prophets and the Psalms.”\n\nSo we pray the Psalms after Jesus, with Jesus, to Jesus, and through Jesus.\nComposition and Arrangement\nThe 150 prayers have been intentionally ordered and arranged — not gathered randomly. This order is part of the divine inspiration.\nThe Book of Psalms is a collection of collections:\n\nPsalms 1 &amp; 2: Introduction/Prologue\nPsalms 42-49: Sons of Korah collection\nPsalms 73-83: Asaph collection\nPsalms 84-85, 87-88: Sons of Korah\nPsalms 93-100: “Enthronement Psalms” (“The LORD reigns”)\nPsalms 113-118: The Hallel (Egyptian Hallel, associated with Passover)\nPsalms 120-134: Songs of Ascent / Pilgrim Songs\nPsalms 146-150: Final Hallel (each opens/closes with “Hallelujah”)\n\nThe Five Books\nOrganized into five books, echoing the Five Books of Torah:\n\nBook 1: Psalms 3-41\nBook 2: Psalms 42-72\nBook 3: Psalms 73-89\nBook 4: Psalms 90-106\nBook 5: Psalms 107-145\n\nEach concludes with similar doxology: “May the Lord, the God of Israel, be blessed forever. Amen and Amen” (Ps. 41:13, 72:19, 89:52, 106:48)\nTheme #1: From Suffering to Praise\nPsalms of Lament concentrate near the beginning; Psalms of Praise toward the end. Praying through the Psalms moves us through grief to praise. The final five “Hallelujah” Psalms punctuate this.\nTheme #2: The Need for a Joshua-type Successor to David\nPsalms 1-2 as Prologue cause us to consider “the man” — blessed, delighting in God’s teaching (a Joshua figure, cf. Joshua 1:8). This person is like a tree (tree of Life). Psalm 2 presents an anointed Son of David.\nThe Psalter invites us to look for the Joshua/Elisha figure to complement David — namely, Jesus.\nPsalter’s Progression:\n\nBooks 1-2: Historical King David\nBook 3: Decline of David’s throne (mirroring 2 Chronicles)\nBook 4: Exilic period, Moses prominent (Psalm 90), anticipating new Joshua\nBook 5: The greater David/Joshua arrives — fulfillment\n\n\nPsalm 72:20 — “This concludes the prayers of David son of Jesse” signals that subsequent Davidic psalms transcend the historical figure.\n\nTheme #3: Return to the Presence of God\nPsalm 1’s “tree planted by streams of water” alludes to the tree of life in Eden. Humanity has been exiled from God’s presence.\nKey pairings: Sinai/Zion, Tabernacle/Temple, Rebuilt Temple/Jesus.\n\nBooks 1-2: Anticipate building the temple\nBook 3: Possessing the temple guarantees nothing (Psalms 78-79, cf. Jeremiah 7)\nBooks 4-5: Anticipate a new temple — Jesus himself\n\n\nPsalm 118:22-23 — “The stone the builders rejected has become the cornerstone”\n\nThe Psalter is designed as a ‘virtual temple’ — connecting God’s people to His presence through prayer. Through praying the Psalms we join with God’s people to “Praise God in his sanctuary” (Psalm 150:1).\nHistorical Use of the Psalms in Worship\nEarly Church:\n\nTertullian (2nd century): worship revolved around Scripture and Psalms\nJerome (4th century): Psalms sung everywhere\n\nChurch Councils:\n\nLaodicea (381 AD), Chalcedon (451 AD): discouraged anything but Psalms\nBraga (561 AD): prohibited outside poetic compositions\nToledo (7th century): church leaders had to memorize the entire Psalter\n\nThe Reformation:\n\nGenevan Psalter became hugely popular\nFrench Huguenots known as “Psalm-singers”\nScottish Covenanters drew comfort from Psalms in persecution\nAfter Reformation in England, metrical Psalms were almost the only praise songs until mid-18th century\nBy 16th-17th centuries, Psalms sung by virtually every Christian tradition\n\nThe Modern Shift\nIsaac Watts (18th century):\n\nIdentified disconnect between archaic Genevan tunes and contemporary culture\nChampioned singability, clear language, accessible melodies\nMaintained theological depth with poetic flair\n“O God, Our Help in Ages Past,” “When I Survey the Wondrous Cross”\n\nThe Wesley Brothers (18th century):\n\nMethodist revival movement\nHymns as instruments of revival — emotional fervor\nBroader emotional palette in worship\n“Hark! The Herald Angels Sing,” “O for a Thousand Tongues to Sing”\n\nTogether, Watts and the Wesleys ushered in a new era of hymn writing, prioritizing singability and emotional connection.\n20th Century — Contemporary Christian Music:\n\nHymns suffered similar disconnect as Genevan Psalms before them\nBill &amp; Gloria Gaither, Keith Green, Graham Kendrick, Jesus Movement\nCCM traded hymns for folk and rock melodies\n1980s explosion: Amy Grant, Michael W. Smith, megachurches\nHillsong United became global phenomenon\n2000s: diversification, “modern hymn” movement emerged\nDebate over lyrical depth continues\n\nToday: Churches navigate a spectrum — hymns, CCM, blended — but the Psalms, the almost exclusive foundation of worship for centuries, largely remain on the sidelines.\nThe Need for a New Psalter\n\nPeople are suffering and have few resources. The Psalms were that resource.\nThe Psalms offer timeless resources for navigating human emotions\nThey validate emotional experience while urging management through reflection, prayer, and Scripture\nThe church must teach people how to pray the Psalms both corporately and individually\nMusic is necessary and aids in memorization\nWe ought not select Psalms at our own discretion — proceed through them following divine arrangement\n\n\n…to be continued…"},"work/projects/pray150-psalter/research/template":{"slug":"work/projects/pray150-psalter/research/template","filePath":"work/projects/pray150-psalter/research/template.md","title":"Research Article Template","links":["link-to-other-research","link-to-team-member"],"tags":["research","template"],"content":"Research Title Here\nBrief subtitle or hook that explains the significance\nResearch conducted by: Agent Name\nDate: February 8, 2026\nProject: Pray150 South Florida Psalter\n\nSummary\n2-3 paragraph executive summary of findings.

The music is often beautiful, the production excellent, the hearts sincere. Yet something profound is missing.\nThe words being sung are almost entirely human compositions. Meanwhile, the 150 songs God himself gave us—the Psalms—sit silent in the back of our Bibles, read occasionally but rarely sung.\nWhat would happen if the church rediscovered these ancient songs? What if we returned to singing the very words that Jesus sang, that sustained the early church through persecution, that fueled the Reformation, and that have echoed through twenty centuries of Christian worship?\nThe Biblical Foundation: More Than a Suggestion\nThe case for singing Psalms isn’t merely traditional or preferential—it’s biblical. When the Apostle Paul instructs the church about their gathered worship, he writes: “Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, teaching and admonishing one another in all wisdom, singing psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, with thankfulness in your hearts to God” (Colossians 3:16).\nNotice the order: psalms first. This wasn’t accidental. Paul echoes this in Ephesians 5:19, calling believers to address “one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and making melody to the Lord with your heart.” James adds his voice: “Is anyone cheerful? Let him sing praise” (James 5:13)—and the early church would have understood “praise” primarily as the Psalms, the praise book of Scripture.\nThese aren’t peripheral suggestions but central commands for the life of the church. Singing is how the word of Christ dwells in us richly. It’s how we teach and admonish one another. The Psalms are uniquely designed for this purpose—they are Scripture set to song, theology wrapped in poetry, truth that lodges deep in the memory and heart.\nThe Church’s Ancient Practice\nFor the first 1,500 years of Christian worship, psalm-singing wasn’t optional—it was central. The early church inherited the Psalter from their Jewish roots. Jesus himself sang the Psalms (we know he sang the Hallel psalms at the Last Supper). The apostles quoted Psalms constantly in their preaching and writing.\nChurch fathers like Athanasius, Basil, and Augustine wrote extensively about the Psalms as the church’s songbook. Augustine called the Psalms “the voice of the whole church,” noting their unique ability to give expression to every human emotion—joy and sorrow, confidence and doubt, praise and lament—all directed toward God.\nIn the medieval monasteries, the entire Psalter was sung every week in the daily offices. Monks memorized all 150 psalms, praying them in rhythm with the rising and setting sun. The Psalms formed the backbone of Christian worship across continents and centuries.\nThe Reformation Recovery\nThe Protestant Reformation brought renewed emphasis on Scripture, and this included recovering congregational psalm-singing. The Reformers recognized that if worship was to be reformed according to Scripture, the people needed to sing Scripture itself.\nMartin Luther produced metrical psalms in German. John Calvin made psalm-singing central to Reformed worship in Geneva, commissioning the Genevan Psalter that put all 150 psalms into French verse. The Scottish Psalter became the dominant songbook of Presbyterian worship for centuries.\nThese weren’t dusty academic exercises—they were songs of revolution and renewal. Protestant martyrs sang Psalms as they went to the stake. Huguenots sang them in the streets of Paris. Scottish Covenanters sang them on windswept hillsides. The Psalms sustained the church through persecution, gave voice to their deepest longings, and united congregations around the pure word of God.\nThe Modern Decline\nSomewhere in the 20th century, Western evangelicalism largely lost the practice of congregational psalm-singing. Various factors contributed: the rise of the gospel song movement, the influence of popular music styles, the explosive growth of contemporary Christian music as an industry, and perhaps a subtle drift toward valuing novelty over rootedness.\nToday’s worship repertoire is overwhelmingly dominated by songs written in the last 20 years. While many contemporary worship songs contain biblical themes and truths, they are ultimately human reflections on Scripture rather than Scripture itself. We’ve become more comfortable singing our own words about God than singing God’s words back to him.\nThe irony is stark: we claim to be “Bible-believing” churches, yet in the most formative spiritual practice—corporate worship—we’ve largely abandoned the Bible’s own songbook.\nThe Cost of Forgetting\nWhat have we lost in this shift? Several things:\nTheological breadth. The Psalms cover the full spectrum of biblical theology—creation, sin, redemption, judgment, covenant, kingship, wisdom, prophecy, and eschatology. They give us a comprehensive biblical worldview in song.\nEmotional honesty. The Psalms don’t shy away from difficulty. They include laments, complaints, confessions, and raw cries for help alongside exuberant praise. They teach us to bring our whole selves—including our doubts and struggles—before God.\nScriptural formation. When we sing the Psalms, we memorize Scripture. Children who grow up singing Psalm 23 have it in their bones for life. The words return in times of crisis, comfort in grief, and steady the soul in chaos.\nChristological depth. The Psalms are shot through with prophecies and types of Christ. Singing them connects us to the whole redemptive story, from creation’s design to Christ’s fulfillment to the new creation’s promise.\nIntergenerational continuity. When we sing the Psalms, we sing the same songs Jesus sang, the same songs our spiritual ancestors sang for two millennia. We join the great cloud of witnesses, our voices blending across time and space.\nA Movement Stirring\nThe good news is that something is stirring in the church today. Across denominational lines, worship leaders, pastors, and musicians are rediscovering the Psalms and asking: “What if we sang these again?”\nNew psalm-singing projects are emerging—modern settings that honor the text while making it accessible to contemporary congregations. Churches are slowly reintroducing psalms into their worship rotation. Families are singing them at dinner tables. Small groups are chanting them in prayer.\nThis isn’t nostalgia or traditionalism for its own sake. It’s a hunger for rootedness, for biblical substance, for songs that connect us to the whole church across history. It’s a recognition that we need more than our own words—we need God’s words dwelling in us richly.\nA Vision for Renewal\nImagine a church where the Psalms are sung weekly—where children grow up with Psalm 100 and Psalm 46 on their lips, where teenagers facing anxiety find words in Psalm 23 and Psalm 27, where adults walking through suffering discover the laments of Psalm 13 and Psalm 88 give voice to their pain.\nImagine worship services where the joy of Psalm 150 erupts in celebration, where the confession of Psalm 51 leads to genuine repentance, where the instruction of Psalm 1 shapes how we think about life and godliness.\nImagine a generation of believers so saturated in the Psalms that biblical categories shape their thinking, biblical language flows naturally in prayer, and biblical hope anchors them through cultural storms.\nThis isn’t fantasy—it’s recovery. It’s what the church has done for most of its history. And it’s within reach again.\nJoining the Movement\nThe South Florida Psalter is one small effort in this larger movement. It’s a project rooted in the belief that local churches can and should return to singing the words God gave us. Not to the exclusion of other music, but as a central, nourishing, formative practice.\nThe vision is simple: to create faithful, beautiful, singable settings of the Psalms that can be used in corporate worship, family devotions, and personal prayer. To help a new generation discover these ancient songs. To participate in the Spirit’s work of letting the word of Christ dwell richly in the church.\nThe Invitation\nYou don’t need permission to start singing the Psalms. You don’t need a committee decision or a denominational mandate. You can begin today.\nStart with one psalm. Learn it. Sing it. Let the words wash over you. Notice what they do in your heart, how they shape your prayers, how they reorient your vision of God and yourself.\nTeach them to your children. Introduce them to your small group. Suggest them to your worship leader. Slowly, patiently, let the Psalter become part of your spiritual vocabulary again.\nThe Psalms have sustained God’s people for three thousand years. They sustained Jesus in the wilderness and on the cross. They sustained the apostles as they planted churches across the Roman Empire. They sustained martyrs in their final moments and reformers in their courageous stands.\nThey’re still here, still living and active, still able to form us into the image of Christ. The question is simply whether we’ll sing them.\nThe invitation stands: Come, let us sing to the Lord. Let us make a joyful noise to the rock of our salvation. Let us come into his presence with thanksgiving and extol him with music and song.\nThe Psalms are waiting. Let’s return them to our worship, and in doing so, let’s return ourselves to the word of God.\n\nElise Hartwell is a content writer and researcher for the South Florida Psalter, an initiative to restore congregational psalm-singing in local church worship.

Scripture-Centered Worship\nOne of their “10 Core Convictions” is “Deep engagement with scripture” - the Psalms are treated as foundational biblical texts for worship, not just hymnic resources.\n2. Christological Interpretation\nFeatured prominently in N.T. Wright’s teaching: “Why the Psalms Are Deeply Christological” (timestamp in his plenary address). The Psalms are understood through a New Testament lens while respecting their original Hebrew context.\n3. Full Emotional Range\nThe Psalm festivals include sections on:\n\nDwelling in God’s Word (teaching Psalms)\nDwelling in God as Our Safe Place (comfort/refuge Psalms)\nDwelling in the Pit of Darkness (lament Psalms - including a “Prayer of Lament”)\nDwelling in the Faithful Love of God (thanksgiving)\nDwelling with God Who Deserves Our Praise (praise Psalms)\n\nThis demonstrates a commitment to the full emotional and theological range of the Psalms, including the difficult lament psalms.\n4. Multicultural &amp; Multilingual Appropriation\nThe Psalm festivals feature:\n\nFirst Nations Version translations (Terry &amp; Darlene Wildman)\nCeltic musical settings (Celtic Psalms group)\nKorean, Spanish, and English texts\nMultiple musical styles (from Genevan Psalter tunes to contemporary settings)\n\n5. Active Congregational Participation\nAnother core conviction: “The full, conscious, active participation of all worshipers” - Psalms are sung congregationally, not just performed.\n6.

Wright (2012)\nVideo URL: youtu.be/aSb62xG9om0\nFull Title: “Praying the Psalms, N. T. Wright”\nEvent: 2012 Calvin Symposium on Worship - Plenary Address\nSpeaker: Tom [N.T.] Wright\nDuration: Not specified (companion video is 1 hour, 7 minutes)\nViews: 68,603\nPosted: April 9, 2012\nVideo Description\n“Praying the Psalms: Personal, Pastoral, Theological and Liturgical Reflections - a plenary address by Tom [N.T.] Wright at the 2012 Calvin Symposium on Worship, sponsored by the Calvin Institute of Christian Worship. Wright presents a New Testament perspective on the use of Psalms in Christian worship.”\nKey Moments (Timestamped Sections)\nThe video includes these chapter markers:\n\nTom Wright (0:02) - Introduction\nThe Second Temple Jews (4:02) - Historical context\nWhy the Psalms Are Deeply Christological (13:36) - Core theological argument\nPsalm 90 (16:53) - Specific psalm study\nPsalm 102 (17:28) - Specific psalm study\nPsalm 103 (17:49) - Specific psalm study\nPsalm 8 (20:39) - Specific psalm study\nPsalm 51 (21:39) - Specific psalm study\n\nKey Learning Points\n1. The Psalms Are Deeply Christological\nThis is Wright’s central thesis (marked at 13:36). From a New Testament perspective, the Psalms are not just Hebrew poetry that Christians happen to use - they are fundamentally about Christ and read through Christ.\nImplication for Pray150: Scott’s vision aligns here - singing the Psalms is not about recovering an Old Testament practice, but about Christian prayer shaped by Jesus. The Psalms prepare us for and point us toward Christ.\n2. Second Temple Jewish Context Matters\nWright begins with the Second Temple period (4:02) - understanding how Jews between the Testaments used the Psalms informs how early Christians adopted them.\nHistorical Connection: Jesus and the apostles learned to pray the Psalms in this context. They inherited a living tradition of psalm-praying, not just ancient texts.\n3. Personal, Pastoral, Theological, and Liturgical Dimensions\nThe subtitle reveals Wright’s framework - the Psalms work on multiple levels:\n\nPersonal: Individual prayer life\nPastoral: Caring for souls through scripture\nTheological: Deep doctrine embedded in poetry\nLiturgical: Corporate worship practice\n\nFor Pray150: A comprehensive Psalter can’t just be hymnological - it must serve all four dimensions.\n4. Specific Psalms Wright Focuses On\n\nPsalm 90: Mortality, God’s eternity, human frailty\nPsalm 102: Lament, suffering, hope\nPsalm 103: Praise, God’s mercy and compassion\nPsalm 8: Human dignity, creation, God’s glory\nPsalm 51: Confession, repentance, renewal\n\nPattern: Wright doesn’t just discuss “happy” psalms - he includes lament (102) and penitence (51). The full emotional range is represented.\n5. New Testament Scholarly Authority\nN.T. Wright is one of the world’s most respected New Testament scholars. His endorsement of psalm-praying carries significant theological weight, especially for evangelicals who might dismiss psalms as “Old Testament law.”\nStrategic Value: Wright bridges academic scholarship and congregational practice - exactly what Pray150 needs to gain credibility.\n\nRelated Video: “Praying the Psalms” (Companion Session)\nURL: www.youtube.com/watch\nDuration: 1 hour, 7 minutes\nViews: 7,900+\nPosted: 13 years ago\nThis appears to be session 2 of Wright’s plenary address. Combined with the first video, this represents Wright’s full teaching on the Psalms at the 2012 Symposium.\nResearch Note: I couldn’t access the full transcript in this session, but the view count (7.9K vs 68K) suggests the first video is the primary resource. Both should be watched for complete understanding.\n\nRecent Psalm Festival: “Dwelling with God in the Psalms” (Feb 6, 2026)\nVideo URL: www.youtube.com/watch\nDuration: 1 hour, 36 minutes\nEvent: Friday Psalm Festival (part of “Dwelling in the Psalms” year)\nStreamed: February 6, 2026\nViews: 152 (very recent)\nFull Service Order (From Description)\nThis is a fully liturgical psalm service - not just a lecture or concert, but corporate worship built entirely around psalms. Here’s the complete structure:\nOpening\n\n\nCall to Worship and Opening Prayer\n\n\nSong: Psalm 133 “See How Good It Is”\n\nLed by Bellwether Arts\nText/Music: Sandra McCracken and Wendell Kimbrough (2019)\n\n\n\nGod’s Greeting\n\n\nPsalm Prayer in response to Psalm 133\n\n\nSection I: Dwelling in God’s Word\n\nArtist’s Reflection - Led by Anneke Kaai\nReading: Psalm 1 from First Nations Version\n\nLed by Terry Wildman and Darlene Wildman\n\n\nSong: Psalm 119:1-8 “Blessed Are All (Only in Jesus)”\n\nLed by Bellwether Arts\nText/Music: Zac Hicks (2019)\n\n\nSong: Psalm 119:145-152 “I Call Your Name”\n\nLed by Bellwether Arts\nText/Music: Mac Meador (2019)\n\n\nPsalm Prayer in response to Psalm 119\n\nSection II: Dwelling in God as Our Safe Place\n\nArtist’s Reflection - Led by Anneke Kaai\nReading: Psalm 31:1-5 from First Nations Version\n\nLed by Terry &amp; Darlene Wildman\n\n\nSong: Psalm 23 “Grandfather”\n\nLed by Darlene and Terry Wildman\nText/Music: Psalm 23 (First Nations Version), Terry Wildman and Brian Doerksen (2025)\n\n\nSong: Psalm 139 “Beautiful Mystery”\n\nLed by Darlene and Terry Wildman\nText/Music: Terry Wildman, Darlene Wildman, and Brian Doerksen (2025)\n\n\nPsalm Prayer in response to Psalm 143\n\nSection III: Dwelling in the Pit of Darkness\n\nArtist’s Reflection - Led by Anneke Kaai\nReading: Psalm 130 from First Nations Version\n\nLed by Terry &amp; Darlene Wildman\n\n\nSilent Prayer\nPrayer of Lament\nSong: Psalms 58, 59, and 60 “O When Will We See Justice Done?”\n\nLed by CICW Staff\nText: Carol Bechtel (2011)\nMusic: KINGSFOLD (English traditional, arr.

Structural Framework: Five Movements\nThe service organizes psalms thematically:\n\nGod’s Word (teaching)\nGod as Safe Place (refuge)\nThe Pit of Darkness (lament)\nGod’s Faithful Love (thanksgiving)\nGod Who Deserves Praise (praise)\n\nFor Pray150: This is a brilliant organizing schema! It doesn’t just group psalms by “type” (lament, praise, etc.) but by theological posture and experience of God.\n2. Integration of Indigenous Voices\nThe First Nations Version is used for all readings. Terry and Darlene Wildman lead original psalm songs. This isn’t tokenism - it’s theological: the Psalms speak in every culture’s voice.\nFor Pray150: Scott’s vision is cross-cultural. This model shows how to honor indigenous expressions without appropriation (Indigenous creators lead and compose).\n3. Artist Reflections Create Space\nAnneke Kaai provides an “Artist’s Reflection” before each section - creating contemplative space and visual/artistic interpretation alongside music and text.\nFor Pray150: Not just songs - the service includes teaching moments and silence. Worship isn’t rushed.\n4. Lament Gets Full Treatment\nSection III doesn’t shy away from darkness:\n\nSilent prayer\nPrayer of lament\nImprecatory psalms (58, 59, 60) - “O When Will We See Justice Done?”\nReferences Psalm 102 (one of the harshest lament psalms)\n\nCrucial Point: The lament section is placed in the middle, not at the beginning or end. You dwell in darkness between safety and praise. This is liturgically and theologically sophisticated.\n5. Musical Diversity Is Intentional\n\nBellwether Arts: Contemporary worship style (Sandra McCracken, Zac Hicks, etc.)\nCeltic Psalms: Traditional Irish/Scottish tunes with new texts\nFirst Nations: Indigenous musical sensibility\nCICW Staff: Classic hymn tune (KINGSFOLD)\nMultilingual Doxology: Global church voices\n\nFor Pray150: One psalter, many musical styles. Unity doesn’t mean uniformity.\n6. Psalm Prayers Frame Each Section\nAfter singing, there’s a spoken psalm prayer - connecting sung praise to verbal intercession. This prevents psalms from being mere performance.\nFor Pray150: Singing isn’t the endpoint. The psalm should move you to pray.\n7. Copyright &amp; Contemporary Composition\nMultiple recent compositions (2015-2025) show that psalm-singing is living tradition, not museum piece. New settings by:\n\nSandra McCracken &amp; Wendell Kimbrough\nZac Hicks\nMac Meador\nKiran Young Wimberly\nTerry &amp; Darlene Wildman\nHope College Worship\n\nFor Pray150: Scott doesn’t need to write all 150 settings himself - he can curate and commission from living composers.\n8. First Nations Version As Translation\nThis isn’t just using Native American musical style - it’s using a culturally-contextualized Bible translation (First Nations Version). The text itself is indigenous.\nResearch Question: What is the First Nations Version? Who created it? How does it handle Hebrew poetry? This deserves deeper study.\n\nAdditional Recent Psalm Videos\n”Shaped by the Psalms: A Psalm Festival”\nURL: www.youtube.com/watch\nDuration: 1 hour, 52 minutes\nStreamed: February 6, 2026\nViews: 47\nAnother Friday Psalm Festival session, likely with similar structure. Need to watch for additional insights.\n”Thirsting for our Faithful God”\nURL: www.youtube.com/watch\nDuration: 2 hours, 3 minutes\nStreamed: February 6, 2026\nViews: 32\nThird session in the recent festival. The title suggests focus on refuge/longing psalms (possibly Psalm 42, 63, 84, etc.).\n”Psalm Singing and the Genevan Psalter”\nURL: www.youtube.com/watch\nDuration: 1 hour, 8 minutes\nStreamed: 3 months ago (November 2025)\nViews: 1,200+\nKey Topic: The historical Genevan Psalter - John Calvin’s metrical psalter (1562), which set all 150 psalms to meter for congregational singing. This is the Reformation model for what Scott is attempting.\nWhy This Matters: The Genevan Psalter proves that full-Psalter congregational singing is possible. Calvin and his colleagues did it. This isn’t a new idea - it’s a renewal of a 16th-century practice.\nResearch Priority: HIGH. This video likely explains:\n\nHow the Genevan Psalter was structured\nWhat tunes were used\nHow it shaped Reformed worship\nWhy it fell out of use\nHow it’s being recovered today\n\n\nTheological Themes Across Videos\n1. Psalms as Christian Prayer\nBoth Wright’s lectures and the festival services treat psalms as Christian prayer, not just Hebrew poetry. This is crucial for evangelical acceptance.\n2. Full Emotional Range\nLament, penitence, praise, thanksgiving, wisdom - all present. No sanitizing.\n3. Christological Hermeneutic\nWright’s “deeply Christological” emphasis means psalms point to Christ, are prayed by Christ, and shape Christian identity.\n4. Corporate Over Individual\nThese are worship services, not devotional aids. Psalms are for the church gathered, not just personal quiet times.\n5. Cultural Diversity as Theological Necessity\nNot just stylistic preference - the global church prays the psalms in culturally distinct ways because that’s how the Spirit works.\n6. Historical Recovery + Contemporary Creation\nBoth/and: honor Genevan Psalter and commission new settings. Tradition and innovation together.\n\nMusical Groups/Composers to Research Further\n\nBellwether Arts - Contemporary worship collective setting psalms\nCeltic Psalms - Traditional Celtic musical style with new texts\nSandra McCracken - Psalm 133 setting\nWendell Kimbrough - Psalm 133 co-composer\nZac Hicks - Psalm 119:1-8 composer\nMac Meador - Psalm 119:145-152 composer\nKiran Young Wimberly - Celtic Psalms text adapter\nTerry &amp; Darlene Wildman - First Nations Version, Psalm 23 &amp; 139 composers\nBrian Doerksen - Co-composer with Wildmans\nHope College Worship - Psalm 150 composers\nCarol Bechtel - Psalm 58-60 text writer\n\n\nResources Mentioned\nPublications\n\nFirst Nations Version - Indigenous Bible translation (need more info on publisher/translators)\nSongs from hymnal “Santo, Santo, Santo / Holy, Holy, Holy” (bilingual hymnal mentioned in Carlos Colón videos)\n\nMusic Publishers\n\nIntegrity Music\nPaper News Publishing\nUnbudding Fig Music\nCardiphonia Music\nGIA Publications, Inc.\nKevin Mayhew Ltd.\nFaith Alive Christian Resources\n\nLicensing\nAll content uses CCLI licensing (Christian Copyright Licensing International) - suggesting these resources are available for church use.\n\nQuestions for Further Research\n\nWho created the First Nations Version? Is it a full Bible or just selections?\nWhat is Bellwether Arts’ full catalog? Do they have a complete psalm collection?\nHow does Celtic Psalms approach meter and melody? Are they singable by average congregations?\nWhat happened to the Genevan Psalter? Why did Reformed churches abandon it?\nDoes CICW have a theological statement on psalm-singing? Beyond these videos, is there written work?\nWho is Anneke Kaai? What’s her role as “artist” in the services?\nIs there a curated psalm database? Does Hymnary.org (their resource) catalog all available psalm settings?\n\n\nStrategic Insights for Pray150\nWhat Scott Is Doing Right\n\nAll 150 Psalms - CICW does thematic collections; Scott’s comprehensive vision is unique\nAccessible to Small Churches - CICW has institutional resources; Scott is DIY/grassroots\nFree Church Context - CICW is mainline/Reformed; Scott bridges to evangelical/Baptist world\nTheological Framework (95 Theses) - Scott has articulated “why” in ways CICW assumes\n\nWhat Scott Can Learn\n\nThematic Groupings - The five-movement structure (Word, Safe Place, Darkness, Love, Praise) could organize Pray150 liturgically\nCommission Composers - Don’t write all 150 himself; curate and commission\nMultiple Musical Styles - One project can include contemporary, traditional, Celtic, gospel, etc.\nArtist Reflections - Include teaching/devotional content alongside songs\nLament in the Middle - Placement matters liturgically\nCultural Humility - Collaborate with Indigenous, African American, Latino/a creators\nPsalm Prayers - Include spoken prayers shaped by each psalm\n\nCompetitive Landscape\nCICW represents the institutional/academic approach to psalm renewal. They have:\n\nUniversity backing\nGrant funding (Lilly Endowment)\n27+ years of history\nScholarly credibility (N.T. Wright, etc.)\nPublishing partnerships\n\nScott’s Pray150 offers:\n\nGrassroots/organic approach\nFree church accessibility\nComplete 150-psalm vision (not just selections)\nTheological urgency (“95 Theses” manifesto)\nDigital-first, permission-free distribution\n\nNot competition - complementary. CICW provides scholarly foundation; Pray150 provides practical tool.\n\nNext Steps for Research\n\nWatch full N.T. Wright lectures - extract detailed theological arguments\nStudy Genevan Psalter video - understand historical model\nResearch First Nations Version - who, what, where to get it\nExplore Bellwether Arts catalog - find their full psalm settings\nCheck Hymnary.org - map existing psalm settings comprehensively\nContact CICW directly - ask about their “Dwelling in the Psalms” year-long initiative\nFind written materials - are there articles or books from this research?\n\n\nDate Completed: February 7, 2026\nResearcher: Elise Hartwell\nNext Update: After viewing full videos and conducting follow-up research"},"work/projects/pray150-psalter/resources/Psalm-001-Blessed-Is-The-One-G-chords-v2":{"slug":"work/projects/pray150-psalter/resources/Psalm-001-Blessed-Is-The-One-G-chords-v2","filePath":"work/projects/pray150-psalter/resources/Psalm-001-Blessed-Is-The-One-G-chords-v2.md","title":"Psalm-001-Blessed-Is-The-One-G-chords-v2","links":[],"tags":[],"content":"Psalm 001 — Blessed Is The One\nKey: G\nTempo: 72 BPM (4/4)\nSource: Scott’s Pray150 recording — [NEEDS VERIFICATION]\n\nNote on This Transcription\nThis v2 chord chart was created for accuracy verification against Scott’s actual YouTube recording.

Denominational Identity\nScott is a minister in the Christian Reformed Church in North America (CRCNA) — the Reformed tradition. Calvin University (formerly Calvin College) is the CRCNA’s denominational college. This means:\n\nHe has deep roots in the Reformed worship tradition\nHe understands and respects the Genevan Psalter heritage\nHe stands within the tradition that CICW represents and studies\n\n2. Position on the Genevan Psalter\nScott wants to be clear:\n\nHe honors the Genevan Psalter’s history and significance\nHe believes the church needs to move on from Genevan Psalms for modern worship\nGenevan tunes don’t fit contemporary worship contexts\nWe need a new Psalter for today’s church\n\n3. Why SFP Exists\nThe core insight: No one else is working on a comprehensive, modern, word-for-word Psalter the way Scott is. The gap is real. The need is immediate.\n4. Strategic Positioning\nWhen writing about this:\n\nAcknowledge the Genevan tradition as foundation\nPosition SFP as building upon it, not replacing it\nEmphasize reaching churches with no Psalm-singing tradition (the “unreached”)\nFrame as evolution, not rejection\n\nSuggested Messaging\n\n“Honoring the past, singing for today”\n“The Psalms — reimagined for modern worship”\n“Complete Psalter for the contemporary church”\n\nThis context should inform your ongoing research and any articles you’re developing about the Psalms in worship.\n—Clark\n\nOriginal feedback: February 8, 2026\nSource: Scott’s notes on CICW research review"},"work/projects/pray150-psalter/team/updates/mara-selah-skills-activated":{"slug":"work/projects/pray150-psalter/team/updates/mara-selah-skills-activated","filePath":"work/projects/pray150-psalter/team/updates/mara-selah-skills-activated.md","title":"New Skills Activated: Mara & Selah","links":[],"tags":["team","skills","mara","selah","activation"],"content":"New Skills Activated: Mara &amp;

As we begin a brand-new year together, we’re launching a new sermon series through Colossians—starting with Colossians 1:1–14.\nPaul writes to a young, healthy church he has never met, and his message is both simple and life-changing: it’s not Jesus plus something… it’s Jesus.\n\nNot Jesus + philosophy.\nNot Jesus + rules.\nNot Jesus + mystical experiences.\nJust Christ—supreme, sufficient, and preeminent.\n\n\nKey Themes\n\nThe sufficiency of Christ alone — We don’t need to add anything to the gospel\nRejecting syncretism — Jesus + anything else dilutes the gospel\nThe gospel Paul preached — Faith, love, and hope rooted in the truth\nThe lordship of Christ — Over all philosophies and religions\n\n\nOutline\n\n\nIntroduction: A New Year, The Same Gospel\n\nThe temptation to seek “new” spirituality\nPaul’s timeless message: Jesus is enough\n\n\n\nPaul’s Greeting (vv. 1-2)\n\nAn apostle by God’s will\nTo the saints and faithful brothers in Christ\nGrace and peace from God\n\n\n\nThanksgiving for the Colossians (vv. 3-8)\n\nFaith in Christ Jesus\nLove for all the saints\nThe hope laid up in heaven\nThe gospel bearing fruit everywhere\nEpaphras: a faithful minister\n\n\n\nPrayer for Spiritual Growth (vv. 9-14)\n\nFilled with the knowledge of his will\nWalking in a manner worthy of the Lord\nBearing fruit in every good work\nIncreasing in the knowledge of God\nStrengthened with all power\nGiving thanks to the Father\nTransferred from darkness to light\nRedemption and forgiveness in Christ\n\n\n\n\nKey Quotes\n\n“Not Jesus + philosophy. Not Jesus + rules. Not Jesus + mystical experiences. Just Christ—supreme, sufficient, and preeminent.”\n\n\n“The gospel isn’t something we move on from; it’s something we move deeper into.”\n\n\nApplication\n\nWhat are you tempted to add to Jesus? Identify the “plus” in your life\nRest in sufficiency — You don’t need more than Christ\nPray like Paul — For knowledge, worthy walk, fruit, strength, and thanksgiving\nRemember your rescue — You’ve been transferred from darkness to light\n\n\nConnection to Christ\nThis opening passage establishes the foundation: Christ is sufficient for salvation, sanctification, and every spiritual need. The Colossians didn’t need to add philosophy or legalism to their faith because Jesus had already given them everything.\n\nFor Further Study\n\nEphesians 1:3-14 (parallel opening)\nPhilippians 3:1-11 (no confidence in the flesh)\nGalatians 1:6-9 (no other gospel)\n\n\nNext: Burn the Caricature: Seeing the Real Jesus (Colossians 1:15-23)"},"work/sermons/by-series/colossians/02-burn-the-caricature":{"slug":"work/sermons/by-series/colossians/02-burn-the-caricature","filePath":"work/sermons/by-series/colossians/02-burn-the-caricature.md","title":"Burn the Caricature: Seeing the Real Jesus","links":["/","work/sermons/by-series/colossians/01-new-year-same-gospel","03-christ-in-you"],"tags":["colossians","christology","supremacy-of-christ","reconciliation","false-teaching"],"content":"Burn the Caricature: Seeing the Real Jesus\nSeries: Colossians: Jesus + Nothing\nDate: January 13, 2026\nScripture: Colossians 1:15-23\nDuration: 46 minutes\nVideo: Watch on YouTube\n\nSummary\nMany people carry a distorted image of Jesus—a caricature shaped by culture, false teaching, or incomplete gospel presentations.

Paul responds with the most exalted description of Christ in the Bible: Jesus doesn’t need supplements; he is the full and final revelation of God.\n\nFor Further Study\n\nJohn 1:1-18 (the Word made flesh)\nHebrews 1:1-4 (the radiance of God’s glory)\nPhilippians 2:5-11 (the name above every name)\n\n\nPrevious: New Year, Same Gospel | Next: Christ in You: The Fuel for Ministry"},"work/sermons/by-series/colossians/index":{"slug":"work/sermons/by-series/colossians/index","filePath":"work/sermons/by-series/colossians/index.md","title":"Colossians: Jesus + Nothing","links":["05-in-christ-you-are-full","04-contend-for-one-another","03-christ-in-you","work/sermons/by-series/colossians/02-burn-the-caricature","work/sermons/by-series/colossians/01-new-year-same-gospel"],"tags":[],"content":"Colossians: Jesus + Nothing\nJanuary-February 2026\n\n“Not Jesus + philosophy.
